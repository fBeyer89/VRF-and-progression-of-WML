Here, we report how we collected and analyzed data on all 37,648 preprints uploaded to bioRxiv.org, the largest biology-focused preprint server, in its first five years. The rate of preprint uploads to bioRxiv continues to grow (exceeding 2,100 in October 2018), as does the number of downloads (1.1 million in October 2018). We also find that two-thirds of preprints posted before 2017 were later published in peer-reviewed journals, and find a relationship between the number of downloads a preprint has received and the impact factor of the journal in which it is published. We also describe Rxivist.org, a web application that provides multiple ways to interact with preprint metadata.},

  abstract = {Background The role of the duration of obesity as an independent risk factor for mortality has not been investigated. The aim of this study was to analyse the association between the duration of obesity and the risk of mortality.Methods A total of 5036 participants (aged 28{\textendash}62 years) of the Framingham Cohort Study were followed up every 2 years from 1948 for up to 48 years. The association between obesity duration and all-cause and cause-specific mortality was analysed using time-dependent Cox models adjusted for body mass index. The role of biological intermediates and chronic diseases was also explored.Results The adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for mortality increased as the number of years lived with obesity increased. For those who were obese for 1{\textendash}4.9, 5{\textendash}14.9, 15{\textendash}24.9 and {$\geq$}25 years of the study follow-up period, adjusted HRs for all-cause mortality were 1.51 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.27{\textendash}1.79], 1.94 (95\% CI 1.71{\textendash}2.20), 2.25 (95\% CI 1.89{\textendash}2.67) and 2.52 (95\% CI 2.08{\textendash}3.06), respectively, compared with those who were never obese. A dose{\textendash}response relation between years of duration of obesity was also clear for all-cause, cardiovascular, cancer and other-cause mortality. For every additional 2 years of obesity, the HRs for all-cause, cardiovascular disease, cancer and other-cause mortality were 1.06 (95\% CI 1.05{\textendash}1.07), 1.07 (95\% CI 1.05{\textendash}1.08), 1.03 (95\% CI 1.01{\textendash}1.05) and 1.07 (95\% CI 1.05{\textendash}1.11), respectively.Conclusions The number of years lived with obesity is directly associated with the risk of mortality. This needs to be taken into account when estimating its burden on mortality.}

Recently, hippocampal texture has been shown to improve prediction of dementia in patients with mild cognitive impairment, but it is unknown whether texture adds prognostic information beyond volume and shape and whether the predictive value extends to cognitively healthy individuals. Using 510 subjects from the Rotterdam Study, a prospective, population-based cohort study, we investigated if hippocampal volume, shape, texture, and their combination were predictive of dementia and determined how predictive performance varied with time to diagnosis and presence of early clinical symptoms of dementia. All features showed significant predictive performance with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranging from 0.700 for texture alone to 0.788 for the combination of volume and texture. Although predictive performance extended to those without objective cognitive complaints or mild cognitive impairment, performance decreased with increasing follow-up time. We conclude that a combination of multiple hippocampal features on magnetic resonance imaging performs better in predicting dementia in the general population than any feature by itself.},

It was cited 3364 times in Google Scholar in the five years after its publication. However, in June 2018 the trial was retracted and republished because serious protocol deviations were detected. Moreover, the repercussions of these protocol deviations and of the correction process raise many additional important questions. How do you correct one of the most influential trials and the large universe of its secondary publications?PREDIMED was originally published in 2013.1 Heralded as a pioneer effort in nutrition,2 it randomised 7447 participants to a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra virgin olive oil, a Mediterranean diet supplemented with nuts, or a control diet. It showed a 30\% relative risk reduction in a composite clinical endpoint of cardiovascular death, stroke, or myocardial infarction in the Mediterranean diet groups.1 PREDIMED was an important effort and one of the few long term trials with clinical outcomes in nutrition.However, some concerns were raised at the time of the publication. The interventions tested were not a typical Mediterranean diet but single food supplementations. The control group experience was not necessarily non-Mediterranean. The primary outcome was a composite of three endpoints,34 and significant differences were driven by a single endpoint (stroke) without differences in other cardiovascular disease or death. Effect sizes were probably inflated because the trial was stopped early after interim analyses showed benefit. Several systematic reviews and guidelines have either omitted PREDIMED56 or have rated it as having serious risk of bias and being difficult to interpret.7 Moreover, secondary PREDIMED analyses reported results that {\dots}}

Compared with controls and aMCI, AD was associated with opposing connectivity effects in the DMN (decreased) and frontal networks (enhanced). The only RS abnormality found in aMCI patients compared with controls was a precuneus connectivity reduction in the DMN. RS fMRI group differences were only partly related to gray matter atrophy. In AD patients, the mean executive network connectivity was positively associated with frontal-executive and language neuropsychological scores. These results suggest that AD is associated with an alteration of large-scale functional brain networks, which extends well beyond the DMN. In AD, the limited resources of the DMN may be paralleled, in an attempt to maintain cognitive efficiency, by an increased prefrontal connectivity. A medial parietal RS fMRI signal change seems to be present since the early phase of AD.},

  abstract = {Observational studies suggest that diet is linked to cognitive health. However, the duration of follow-up in many studies is not sufficient to take into account the long preclinical phase of dementia, and the evidence from interventional studies is not conclusive.To examine whether midlife diet is associated with subsequent risk for dementia.Population-based cohort study established in 1985-1988 that had dietary intake assessed in 1991-1993, 1997-1999, and 2002-2004 and follow-up for incident dementia until March 31, 2017.Food frequency questionnaire to derive the Alternate Healthy Eating Index (AHEI), an 11-component diet quality score (score range, 0-110), with higher scores indicating a healthier diet.Incident dementia ascertained through linkage to electronic health records.Among 8225 participants without dementia in 1991-1993 (mean age, 50.2 years [SD, 6.1 years]; 5686 [69.1\%] were men), a total of 344 cases of incident dementia were recorded during a median follow-up of 24.8 years (interquartile range, 24.2-25.1 years). No significant difference in the incidence rate for dementia was observed in tertiles of AHEI exposure during 1991-1993, 1997-1999 (median follow-up, 19.1 years), and 2002-2004 (median follow-up, 13.5 years). Compared with an incidence rate for dementia of 1.76 (95\% CI, 1.47-2.12) per 1000 person-years in the worst tertile of AHEI (lowest tertile of diet quality) in 1991-1993, the absolute rate difference for the intermediate tertile was 0.03 (95\% CI, -0.43 to 0.49) per 1000 person-years and for the best tertile was 0.04 (95\% CI, -0.42 to 0.51) per 1000 person-years. Compared with the worst AHEI tertile in 1997-1999 (incidence rate for dementia, 2.06 [95\% CI, 1.62 to 2.61] per 1000 person-years), the absolute rate difference for the intermediate AHEI tertile was 0.14 (95\% CI, -0.58 to 0.86) per 1000 person-years and for the best AHEI tertile was 0.14 (95\% CI, -0.58 to 0.85) per 1000 person-years. Compared with the worst AHEI tertile in 2002-2004 (incidence rate for dementia, 3.12 [95\% CI, 2.49 to 3.92] per 1000 person-years), the absolute rate difference for the intermediate AHEI tertile was -0.61 (95\% CI, -1.56 to 0.33) per 1000 person-years and for the best AHEI tertile was -0.73 (95\% CI, -1.67 to 0.22) per 1000 person-years. In the multivariable analysis, the adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for dementia per 1-SD (10-point) AHEI increment were not significant as assessed in 1991-1993 (adjusted HR, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.87 to 1.08]), in 1997-1999 (adjusted HR, 0.97 [95\% CI, 0.83 to 1.12]), or in 2002-2004 (adjusted HR, 0.87 [95\% CI, 0.75 to 1.00]).In this long-term prospective cohort study, diet quality assessed during midlife was not significantly associated with subsequent risk for dementia.}

  abstract = {Amyloid-beta is thought to facilitate the spread of tau throughout the neocortex in Alzheimer's disease, though how this occurs is not well understood. This is because of the spatial discordance between amyloid-beta, which accumulates in the neocortex, and tau, which accumulates in the medial temporal lobe during aging. There is evidence that in some cases amyloid-beta-independent tau spreads beyond the medial temporal lobe where it may interact with neocortical amyloid-beta. This suggests that there may be multiple distinct spatiotemporal subtypes of Alzheimer's-related protein aggregation, with potentially different demographic and genetic risk profiles. We investigated this hypothesis, applying data-driven disease progression subtyping models to post-mortem neuropathology and in vivo PET based measures from two large observational studies: the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project. We consistently identified 'amyloid-first' and 'tau-first' subtypes using cross-sectional information from both studies. In the amyloid-first subtype, extensive neocortical amyloid-beta precedes the spread of tau beyond the medial temporal lobe, while in the tau-first subtype mild tau accumulates in medial temporal and neocortical areas prior to interacting with amyloid-beta. As expected, we found a higher prevalence of the amyloid-first subtype among apolipoprotein E (APOE) {$\epsilon$}4 allele carriers while the tau-first subtype was more common among APOE {$\epsilon$}4 non-carriers. Within tau-first APOE {$\epsilon$}4 carriers, we found an increased rate of amyloid-beta accumulation (via longitudinal amyloid PET), suggesting that this rare group may belong within the Alzheimer's disease continuum. We also found that tau-first APOE {$\epsilon$}4 carriers had several fewer years of education than other groups, suggesting a role for modifiable risk factors in facilitating amyloid-beta-independent tau. Tau-first APOE {$\epsilon$}4 non-carriers, in contrast, recapitulated many of the features of Primary Age-related Tauopathy. The rate of longitudinal amyloid-beta and tau accumulation (both measured via PET) within this group did not differ from normal aging, supporting the distinction of Primary Age-related Tauopathy from Alzheimer's disease. We also found reduced longitudinal subtype consistency within tau-first APOE {$\epsilon$}4 non-carriers, suggesting additional heterogeneity within this group. Our findings support the idea that amyloid-beta and tau may begin as independent processes in spatially disconnected regions, with widespread neocortical tau resulting from the local interaction of amyloid-beta and tau. The site of this interaction may be subtype-dependent: medial temporal lobe in amyloid-first, neocortex in tau-first. These insights into the dynamics of amyloid-beta and tau may inform research and clinical trials that target these pathologies.},

In this collaboration of academic, clinical, and pharmaceutical industry perspectives, we identify outstanding questions about WMHs and their relation to cognition, dementia, and AD. What molecular and cellular changes underlie WMHs? What are the neuropathological correlates of WMHs? To what extent are demyelination and inflammation present? Is it helpful to subdivide into periventricular and subcortical WMHs? What do WMHs signify in people diagnosed with AD? What are the risk factors for developing WMHs?

  abstract = {Large-scale covariance of cortical thickness or volume in distributed brain regions has been consistently reported by human neuroimaging studies. The mechanism of this population covariance of regional cortical anatomy has been hypothetically related to synchronized maturational changes in anatomically connected neuronal populations. Brain regions that grow together, i.e., increase or decrease in volume at the same rate over the course of years in the same individual, are thus expected to demonstrate strong structural covariance or anatomical connectivity across individuals. To test this prediction, we used a structural MRI dataset on healthy young people (N = 108; aged 9{\textendash}22 years at enrollment), comprising 3{\textendash}6 longitudinal scans on each participant over 6{\textendash}12 years of follow-up. At each of 360 regional nodes, and for each participant, we estimated the following: (1) the cortical thickness in the median scan and (2) the linear rate of change in cortical thickness over years of serial scanning. We constructed structural and maturational association matrices and networks from these measurements. Both structural and maturational networks shared similar global and nodal topological properties, as well as mesoscopic features including a modular community structure, a relatively small number of highly connected hub regions, and a bias toward short distance connections. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data on a subset of the sample (N = 32), we also demonstrated that functional connectivity and network organization was somewhat predictable by structural/maturational networks but demonstrated a stronger bias toward short distance connections and greater topological segregation. Brain structural covariance networks are likely to reflect synchronized developmental change in distributed cortical regions.}

Because mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a prodromal stage for dementia, we sought to evaluate whether changes in weight and body mass index (BMI) may predict incident MCI.Objective~ To investigate the association of change in weight and BMI with risk of MCI.Design, Setting, and Participants~ A population-based, prospective study of participants 70 years of age or older from the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, which was initiated on October 1, 2004. Maximum weight and height in midlife (40-65 years of age) were retrospectively ascertained from the medical records of participants using a medical records{\textendash}linkage system. The statistical analyses were performed between January and November 2015.Main Outcomes and Measures~ Participants were evaluated for cognitive outcomes of normal cognition, MCI, or dementia at baseline and prospectively assessed for incident events at each 15-month evaluation. The association of rate of change in weight and BMI with risk of MCI was investigated using proportional hazards models.Results~ Over a mean follow-up of 4.4 years, 524 of 1895 cognitively normal participants developed incident MCI (50.3\% were men; mean age, 78.5 years). The mean (SD) rate of weight change per decade from midlife to study entry was greater for participants who developed incident MCI vs those who remained cognitively normal (-2.0 [5.1] vs -1.2 [4.9] kg; P\,=\,.006). A greater decline in weight per decade was associated with an increased risk of incident MCI (hazard ratio [HR], 1.04 [95\% CI, 1.02-1.06]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) after adjusting for sex, education, and apolipoprotein E (APOE) {$\epsilon$}4 allele. A weight loss of 5 kg per decade corresponds to a 24\% increase in risk of MCI (HR, 1.24). A higher decrease in BMI per decade was also associated with incident MCI (HR, 1.08 [95\% CI, 1.03-1.13]; P\,=\,.003).Conclusions and Relevance~ These findings suggest that increasing weight loss per decade from midlife to late life is a marker for MCI and may help identify persons at increased risk for MCI.}

In this study, we investigated the relationship between midlife cardiovascular risk factors and late life WMH volumes two decades later, and examined their association with cognitive performance. 135 participants from the Women's Healthy Ageing Project had completed midlife cardiovascular risk measurement in 1992 and late life brain MRI scan and cognitive assessment in 2012. In these community-dwelling normal aging women, we found that higher midlife Framingham Cardiovascular Risk Profile (FCRP) score was associated with greater WMH volume two decades later, and was predominantly driven by the impact of HDL cholesterol level, controlling for age, education and APOE {$\epsilon$}4 status. Structural equation modelling demonstrated that the relationship between midlife FCRP score and late life executive function was mediated by WMH volume. These findings suggest intervention strategies that target major cardiovascular risk factors at midlife might be effective in reducing the development of WMH lesions and thus late life cognitive decline.}

In this paper, we introduce a multivariate analytic approach that optimizes sensitivity and reduces unnecessary testing. We demonstrate the utility of this mega-analytic approach by identifying the effects of age and gender on the resting-state networks (RSNs) of 603 healthy adolescents and adults (mean age: 23.4 years, range: 12-71 years). Data were collected on the same scanner, preprocessed using an automated analysis pipeline based in SPM, and studied using group independent component analysis. RSNs were identified and evaluated in terms of three primary outcome measures: time course spectral power, spatial map intensity, and functional network connectivity. Results revealed robust effects of age on all three outcome measures, largely indicating decreases in network coherence and connectivity with increasing age. Gender effects were of smaller magnitude but suggested stronger intra-network connectivity in females and more inter-network connectivity in males, particularly with regard to sensorimotor networks. These findings, along with the analysis approach and statistical framework described here, provide a useful baseline for future investigations of brain networks in health and disease.},

  abstract = {Executive function has been shown to influence the performance of health behaviours. Healthy eating involves both the inhibitory behaviour of consuming low amounts of saturated fat, and the initiatory behaviour of consuming fruit and vegetables. Based on this distinction, it was hypothesised that these behaviours would have different determinants. Measures of inhibitory control and updating were administered to 115 participants across 2 days. One week later saturated fat intake and fruit and vegetable consumption were measured. Regression analyses revealed a double dissociation effect between the different executive function variables and the prediction of eating behaviours. Specifically, inhibitory control, but not updating, predict saturated fat intake, whilst updating, but not inhibitory control, was related to fruit and vegetable consumption. In both cases, better executive function capacity was associated with healthier eating behaviour. The results support the idea that behaviours that require stopping a response such as limiting saturated fat intake, have different determinants to those that require the initiation of a response such as fruit and vegetable consumption. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving these behaviours should address the relevant facet of executive function.},

While significant sex differences have been reported in the severity of WMH, it is not yet known if the risk factors for WMH differ in men and women. In this study, MRI brain scans from two Australian cohorts were analysed to extract WMH volumes. The objective of this study was to examine the moderation effect by sex in the association between known risk factors and WMH using the generalised linear model. The burden of WMH was significantly higher in women compared to men, especially in the deep WMH (DWMH). In the generalised linear model that included the interaction between sex and body mass index (BMI), there was a differential association of BMI with DWMH in men and women in the exploratory sample, i.e. the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS), n= 432, aged between 70 to 90. The finding of a higher BMI associated with a higher DWMH in men compared to women was replicated in the Older Australian Twins Study (OATS) sample, n= 179, aged between 65 to 90. The risk factors of WMH pathology are suggested to have a different impact on the ageing brains of men and women.},

Non-invasive blood markers for risk stratification and dissection of inflammatory molecular substrates in vivo are lacking. We sought to identify whether an interconnected network of inflammatory biomarkers centered on IL-18 and all previously associated with white matter lesions could detect overt and antecedent white matter changes in two populations at risk for cerebral small vessel disease. In a cohort of 167 older adults (mean age: 76, SD 7.1, 83 females) that completed a cognitive battery, physical examination, and blood draw in parallel with MR imaging including DTI, we measured cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and free water (FW). Concurrently, serum levels of a biologic network of inflammation molecules including MPO, GDF-15, RAGE, ST2, IL-18, and MCP-1 were measured. The ability of a log-transformed population mean-adjusted inflammatory composite score (ICS) to associate with MR variables was demonstrated in an age and total intracranial volume adjusted model. In this cohort, ICS was significantly associated with WMH ({$\beta$} = 0.222, p = 0.013), FW ({$\beta$} = 0.3, p = 0.01), and with the number of vascular risk factor diagnoses (r = 0.36, p{$<$}0.001). In a second cohort of 131 subjects presenting for the evaluation of acute neurologic deficits concerning for stroke, we used serum levels of 11 inflammatory biomarkers in an unbiased principal component analysis which identified a single factor significantly associated with WMH. This single factor was strongly correlated with the six component ICS identified in the first cohort and was associated with WMH in a generalized linear regression model adjusted for age and gender (p = 0.027) but not acute stroke. A network of inflammatory molecules driven by IL-18 is associated with overt and antecedent white matter injury resulting from cerebrovascular disease and may be a promising peripheral biomarker for vascular white matter injury.}

The pathogenesis of olfactory dysfunction in COVID-19 is not yet fully understood. MR imaging represents a useful anatomic imaging method for the evaluation of olfactory dysfunction associated with varying etiologies, including viral infection, trauma, and neurodegenerative processes. This case-control study was conducted to compare quantitative measurements of olfactory anatomic structures between patients diagnosed with COVID-19 associated with persistent olfactory dysfunction and healthy controls.MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study has a retrospective design. Cranial MR imaging was performed on all participants in both the patient and control groups. The bilateral olfactory bulb volume, olfactory tract length, and olfactory sulcus depth were measured in all patients.RESULTS: A total of 116 people aged 18{\textendash}60\,years, including 36 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and 80 controls, were included in the study. All measured values were compared between the patient and control groups. The right, left, and total olfactory bulb volume values were significantly lower in the patient group than in the control group. The patient group also had significantly lower right and left olfactory sulcus depth and olfactory tract length values compared with those in the control group.CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging findings can be used to demonstrate olfactory injury in patients with COVID-19.

In all studies, MRI was performed at baseline, cognitive tests repeated during follow-up, and progression to dementia recorded prospectively. Outcome measures were cognitive decline and onset of dementia during follow-up. We determined whether the SVD score predicted risk of cognitive decline and future dementia. We also determined whether using the score to select a group of patients with more severe disease would reduce sample sizes for clinical intervention trials.Results In a pooled analysis of all 3 cohorts, the score improved prediction of dementia (area under the curve [AUC], 0.85; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.81{\textendash}0.89) compared with that from clinical risk factors alone (AUC, 0.76; 95\% CI, 0.71{\textendash}0.81).

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) has traditionally been regarded as a disease of the gray matter (GM). However, the advent of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) has contributed to new knowledge about how changes in white matter (WM) microstructure in vivo may be directly related to the pathophysiology of AD. It is now evident that WM is heavily affected in AD, even at early stages. Still, our knowledge about WM degeneration in AD is poor compared to what we know about GM atrophy. For instance, it has not been clear if WM can be directly affected in AD independently of GM degeneration, or whether WM changes mainly represent secondary effects of GM atrophy, e.g. through Wallerian degeneration. In this paper, we review recent studies using DTI to study WM alterations in AD. These studies suggest that microstructural WM affection at pre-AD stages cannot completely be accounted for by concomitant GM atrophy. Further, recent research has demonstrated relationships between increased cerebrospinal fluid levels of Tau proteins and changes in WM microstructure indexed by DTI, which could indicate that WM degeneration in pre-AD stages is related to ongoing axonal damage. We conclude that DTI is a promising biomarker for AD, with the potential also to identify subgroups of patients with especially high degree of WM affection, thereby contributing to more differentiated pre-AD diagnoses. However, more research and validation studies are needed before it is realistic to use this information in clinical practice with individual patients.},

However, these studies include small sample sizes, particularly in the older age groups, when the incidence of dementia is highest. Methods: Pooled analysis of four population-based prospective cohort studies was performed. The sample included persons 65 years and older, 528 incident cases of dementia, and 28,768 person-years of follow-up. Incident cases were identified in a two-stage procedure in which the total cohort was screened for cognitive impairment, and screen positives underwent detailed diagnostic assessment. Dementia and main subtypes of AD and vascular dementia were diagnosed according to internationally accepted guidelines. Sex- and age-specific incidence rates, and relative and cumulative risks for total dementia, AD, and vascular dementia were calculated using log linear analysis and Poisson regression. Results: There were significant gender differences in the incidence of AD after age 85 years. At 90 years of age, the rate was 81.7 (95\% CI, 63.8 to 104.7) in women and 24.0 (95\% CI, 10.3 to 55.6) in men. There were no gender differences in rates or risk for vascular dementia. The cumulative risk for 65-year-old women to develop AD at the age of 95 years was 0.22 compared with 0.09 for men. The cumulative risk for developing vascular dementia at the age of 95 years was similar for men and women (0.04). Conclusion: Compared with men, women have an increased risk for AD. There are no gender differences in risk for vascular dementia.}

Plasma insulin rose from 8 +/- 1 microU/ml during control, to 72 +/- 8 and 144 +/- 13 microU/ml during the low and high insulin doses, respectively, and fell to 15 +/- 6 microU/ml 1 h after insulin infusion was stopped. MSNA, which averaged 21.5 +/- 1.5 bursts/min in control, increased significantly (P less than 0.001) during both the low and high doses of insulin (+/- 5.4 and +/- 9.3 bursts/min, respectively) and further increased during 1-h recovery (+15.2 bursts/min). Plasma norepinephrine levels (119 +/- 19 pg/ml during control) rose during both low (258 +/- 25; P less than 0.02) and high (285 +/- 95; P less than 0.01) doses of insulin and recovery (316 +/- 23; P less than 0.01). Plasma epinephrine levels did not change during insulin infusion. Despite the increased MSNA and plasma norepinephrine, there were significant (P less than 0.001) increases in forearm blood flow and decreases in forearm vascular resistance during both doses of insulin. Systolic pressure did not change significantly during infusion of insulin and diastolic pressure fell approximately 4-5 mmHg (P less than 0.01). This study suggests that acute increases in plasma insulin within the physiological range elevate sympathetic neural outflow but produce forearm vasodilation and do not elevate arterial pressure in normal humans.}

  abstract = {Despite its great potential in studying brain anatomy and structure, diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) is marred by artefacts more than any other commonly used MRI technique. In this paper we present a non-parametric framework for detecting and correcting dMRI outliers (signal loss) caused by subject motion. Signal loss (dropout) affecting a whole slice, or a large connected region of a slice, is frequently observed in diffusion weighted images, leading to a set of unusable measurements. This is caused by bulk (subject or physiological) motion during the diffusion encoding part of the imaging sequence. We suggest a method to detect slices affected by signal loss and replace them by a non-parametric prediction, in order to minimise their impact on subsequent analysis. The outlier detection and replacement, as well as correction of other dMRI distortions (susceptibility-induced distortions, eddy currents (EC) and subject motion) are performed within a single framework, allowing the use of an integrated approach for distortion correction. Highly realistic simulations have been used to evaluate the method with respect to its ability to detect outliers (types 1 and 2 errors), the impact of outliers on retrospective correction of movement and distortion and the impact on estimation of commonly used diffusion tensor metrics, such as fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD). Data from a large imaging project studying older adults (the Whitehall Imaging sub-study) was used to demonstrate the utility of the method when applied to datasets with severe subject movement. The results indicate high sensitivity and specificity for detecting outliers and that their deleterious effects on FA and MD can be almost completely corrected.},

In addition a susceptibility-induced field can be supplied and will be incorporated into the calculations in a way that accurately reflects that the two fields (susceptibility- and EC-induced) behave differently in the presence of subject movement. The method is based on registering the individual volumes to a model free prediction of what each volume should look like, thereby enabling its use on high b-value data where the contrast is vastly different in different volumes. In addition we show that the linear EC-model commonly used is insufficient for the data used in the present paper (high spatial and angular resolution data acquired with Stejskal{\textendash}Tanner gradients on a 3T Siemens Verio, a 3T Siemens Connectome Skyra or a 7T Siemens Magnetome scanner) and that a higher order model performs significantly better.

  abstract = {Background Cumulative adversity and stress are associated with risk of psychiatric disorders. While basic science studies show repeated and chronic stress effects on prefrontal and limbic neurons, human studies examining cumulative stress and effects on brain morphology are rare. Thus, we assessed whether cumulative adversity is associated with differences in gray matter volume, particularly in regions regulating emotion, self-control, and top-down processing in a community sample. Methods One hundred three healthy community participants, aged 18 to 48 and 68\% male, completed interview assessment of cumulative adversity and a structural magnetic resonance imaging protocol. Whole-brain voxel-based-morphometry analysis was performed adjusting for age, gender, and total intracranial volume. Results Cumulative adversity was associated with smaller volume in medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), insular cortex, and subgenual anterior cingulate regions (familywise error corrected, p {$<$} .001). Recent stressful life events were associated with smaller volume in two clusters: the medial PFC and the right insula. Life trauma was associated with smaller volume in the medial PFC, anterior cingulate, and subgenual regions. The interaction of greater subjective chronic stress and greater cumulative life events was associated with smaller volume in the orbitofrontal cortex, insula, and anterior and subgenual cingulate regions. Conclusions Current results demonstrate that increasing cumulative exposure to adverse life events is associated with smaller gray matter volume in key prefrontal and limbic regions involved in stress, emotion and reward regulation, and impulse control. These differences found in community participants may serve to mediate vulnerability to depression, addiction, and other stress-related psychopathology.},

The present study compared performance in the TMT and a set-switching task in order to test the assumption that cognitive flexibility is captured in TMT-B performance. Set-switching tasks have low motor and perceptual selection demands, and therefore provide a clearer index of executive function. In this study, participants made category judgments for digits, letters, or symbols across a series of trials, and performance for consecutive same-task trials was compared with task-switch trials. Results of the set-switching task indicated significant switch cost, but only for the situation of task alternation (e.g., an ABA series), suggesting that task-set inhibition may play a role in this effect. Alternating-switch cost was significantly correlated with TMT-B performance, especially with the TMT-B to TMT-A ratio (B/A). Cost for alternating switches was especially large for participants with B/A ratio {$>$} 3. These results provide direct evidence that the B/A ratio of performance in the TMT provides an index of executive function.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder which spans several years from preclinical manifestations to dementia. In recent years, interest in the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms to personalized medicine has grown considerably, and a major challenge that such models face is the transferability from the research settings to clinical practice. The objective of this work was to demonstrate the transferability of the Subtype and Stage Inference (SuStaIn) model from well-characterized research data set, employed as training set, to independent less-structured and heterogeneous test sets representative of the clinical setting. The training set was composed of MRI data of 1043 subjects from the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), and the test set was composed of data from 767 subjects from OASIS, Pharma-Cog, and ViTA clinical datasets. Both sets included subjects covering the entire spectrum of AD, and for both sets volumes of relevant brain regions were derived from T1-3D MRI scans processed with Freesurfer v5.3 cross-sectional stream. In order to assess the predictive value of the model, subpopulations of subjects with stable mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and MCIs that progressed to AD dementia (pMCI) were identified in both sets. SuStaIn identified three disease subtypes, of which the most prevalent corresponded to the typical atrophy pattern of AD. The other SuStaIn subtypes exhibited similarities with the previously defined hippocampal sparing and limbic predominant atrophy patterns of AD. Subject subtyping proved to be consistent in time for all cohorts and the staging provided by the model was correlated with cognitive performance. Classification of subjects on the basis of a combination of SuStaIn subtype and stage, mini mental state examination and amyloid-{$\beta$}1-42 cerebrospinal fluid concentration was proven to predict conversion from MCI to AD dementia on par with other novel statistical algorithms, with ROC curves that were not statistically different for the training and test sets and with area under curve respectively equal to 0.77 and 0.76. This study proves the transferability of a SuStaIn model for AD from research data to less-structured clinical cohorts, and indicates transferability to the clinical setting.},

We aimed at providing a comprehensive contribution to the neural mechanism underlying this effect thanks to a multimodal approach. Thirty-six healthy elders were selected based on neuropsychological assessments and cerebral amyloid imaging, i.e. as presenting normal cognition and a negative florbetapir-PET scan. All subjects underwent structural MRI, FDG-PET and resting-state functional MRI scans. We assessed the relationships between years of education and i) gray matter volume, ii) gray matter metabolism and iii) functional connectivity in the brain areas showing associations with both volume and metabolism. Higher years of education were related to greater volume in the superior temporal gyrus, insula and anterior cingulate cortex and to greater metabolism in the anterior cingulate cortex. The latter thus showed both volume and metabolism increases with education. Seed connectivity analyses based on this region showed that education was positively related to the functional connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus as well as the inferior frontal lobe, posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. Increased connectivity was in turn related with improved cognitive performances. Reinforcement of the connectivity of the anterior cingulate cortex with distant cortical areas of the frontal, temporal and parietal lobes appears as one of the mechanisms underlying education-related reserve in healthy elders.},

BMI, WC, brain imaging, and dementia diagnoses were evaluated at baseline and follow-up. Adipokines were measured at baseline. Brain imaging outcomes included CSVD components, white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, microbleeds, gray and white matter, hippocampal, total brain, and intracranial volumes.Results Cross-sectionally among men at baseline, higher BMI, WC, and leptin were associated with lower gray matter and total brain volumes, and higher BMI and WC were associated with lower hippocampal volume. At follow-up 9 years later, higher BMI was cross-sectionally associated with lower gray matter volume, and an obese WC (\&amp;gt;102 cm) was protective for {$\geq$}1 lacune or {$\geq$}1 microbleed in men. In women, increasing BMI and overweight or obesity (BMI {$\geq$}25 kg/m2 or WC \&amp;gt;88 cm) were associated with {$\geq$}1 lacune. Longitudinally, over 9 years, a baseline obese WC was associated with decreasing hippocampal volume, particularly in men, and increasing white matter hyperintensity volume in women and men.Conclusions Anthropometric and metabolic adiposity predictors were differentially associated with CSVD components and brain volumetry outcomes by sex.

  abstract = {Human life expectancy and the number of the oldest old are rapidly increasing worldwide. Advanced age is the main risk factor for dementia, representing one of the major causes of disability/dependency among older people with a strong impact on their families/caregivers. Centenarians have reached the extreme limits of human life escaping or delaying the major age-related diseases. Thus, these extraordinary individuals embody the best model to answer the crucial question if cognitive decline and dementia are progressive and unavoidable occurrences of increasing age. Despite a growing amount of data underlines the importance of cognitive function for quality of life and survival in old age, studies on centenarians have paid more attention to their physical condition rather than the assessment of their actual cognitive abilities. Accordingly, this work aims to summarize available data on the prevalence of dementia in centenarians and to critically address topics which can have a relevant impact on the cognitive assessment/status of the oldest old: (i) lack of standardized tools for cognitive assessment; (ii) criteria and threshold to establish the presence of dementia; (iii) influence of birth cohort and education; (iv) role of depression or positive attitude towards life; (v) gender differences.},

  abstract = {Background: With the aging of the population, dementia has become an important health concern in most countries. There is a growing body of literature on the importance of cardiovascular risk factors in the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD), vascular dementia, and mixed dementia (AD with cerebrovascular disease). Objective: This article reviews the role of major risk factors in dementia between both sexes. Methods: The MEDLINE, PubMed, and HealthSTAR databases were searched between 1966 and January 2007 for English-language articles on the risk factors for dementia. Results: The distribution and prevalence of major risk factors between the sexes and age groups are varied. Female sex has been associated with increased risk of the development of AD. In women aged {$>$}75 years, rates of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes are higher than in similarly aged men. Apolipoprotein E {$\epsilon$} 4 genotype status appears to have a greater deleterious effect on gross hippocampal pathology and memory performance in women compared with men. Midlife hypertension and hypercholesterolemia in both sexes predict a higher risk of developing AD in later life. Diabetes is increasing in frequency to a greater extent in women than in men, and is associated with a substantial risk for cognitive impairment. Dementia in women (probably) and in men (possibly) is influenced by obesity in the middle of life. Conclusions: It remains critical that large prospective clinical trials be designed to assess the effect of optimum management of vascular risk factors on cognitive functioning and dementia as the primary outcome, and include women and men in numbers adequate for assessment of gender effects.},

  abstract = {Death of oligodendrocyte (OL) precursors can be triggered in vitro by cystine deprivation, a form of oxidative stress that involves depletion of intracellular glutathione. We report here that OLs demonstrate maturation-dependent differences in survival when subjected to free radical-mediated injury induced by glutathione depletion. Using immunopanning to isolate rat preoligodendrocytes (preOLs), we generated highly enriched populations of preOLs and mature OLs under chemically defined conditions. Cystine deprivation caused a similar decrease in glutathione levels in OLs at both stages. However, preOLs were completely killed by cystine deprivation, whereas mature OLs remained viable. Although the glutathione-depleting agents buthionine sulfoximine and diethylmaleate were more potent in depleting glutathione in mature OLs, both agents were significantly more toxic to preOLs. Glutathione depletion markedly increased intracellular free radical generation in preOLs, but not in mature OLs, as indicated by oxidation of the redox-sensitive probe dihydrorhodamine 123. The antioxidants alpha-tocopherol, idebenone, and glutathione monoethylester prevented the oxidation of dihydrorhodamine in cystine-depleted preOLs and markedly protected against cell death. When the intracellular glutathione level was not manipulated, preOLs were also more vulnerable than mature OLs to exogenous free radical toxicity generated by a xanthine-xanthine oxidase system. Ultrastructural features of free radical-mediated injury in glutathione-depleted preOLs included nuclear condensation, margination of chromatin, and mitochondrial swelling. These observations indicate that preOLs are significantly more sensitive to the toxic effects of glutathione depletion and that oligodendroglial maturation is associated with decreased susceptibility to oxidative stress.

  abstract = {Background and purpose The stiffness of large arteries and increased pulsatility can have an impact on the brain white matter (WM) microstructure, however those mechanisms are still poorly understood. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between central artery stiffness, axonal and myelin integrity in 54 cognitively unimpaired elderly subjects (65{\textendash}75 years old). Methods The neuronal fiber integrity of brain WM was assessed using diffusion tensor metrics and magnetization transfer imaging as measures of axonal organization (Fractional anisotropy, Radial diffusivity) and state of myelination (Myelin volume fraction). Central artery stiffness was measured by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV). Statistical analyses included 4 regions (the corpus callosum, the internal capsule, the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus) which have been previously denoted as vulnerable to increased central artery stiffness. Results cfPWV was significantly associated with fractional anisotropy and radial diffusivity (p\,{$<$}\,0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons) but not with myelin volume fraction. Findings from this study also show that improved executive function performance correlates with Fractional anisotropy positively (p\,{$<$}\,0.05 corrected) as well as with myelin volume fraction and radial diffusivity negatively (p\,{$<$}\,0.05 corrected). Conclusions These findings suggest that arterial stiffness is associated with axon degeneration rather than demyelination. Controlling arterial stiffness may play a role in maintaining the health of WM axons in the aging brain.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: To detail the rationale, design, and future perspective of implementing whole-body magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the German National Cohort, a large multicentric population-based study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: All institutional review boards approved the study, and informed consent is obtained before study enrollment. Participants are enrolled from a random sample of the general population at five dedicated imaging sites among 18 recruitment centers. MR imaging facilities are equipped with identical 3.0-T imager technology and use uniform MR protocols. Imager-specific hardware and software settings remained constant over the study period. On-site and centralized measures of image quality enable monitoring of completeness of the acquisitions and quality of each of the MR sequences. Certified radiologists read all MR imaging studies for presence of incidental findings according to predefined algorithms. RESULTS: Over a 4-year period, six participants per day are examined at each center, totaling a final imaging cohort of approximately 30 000 participants. The MR imaging protocol is identical for each site and comprises a set of 12 native series to cover neurologic, cardiovascular, thoracoabdominal, and musculoskeletal imaging phenotypes totaling approximately 1 hour of imaging time. A dedicated analysis platform as part of a central imaging core incorporates a thin client-based integrative and modular data handling platform to enable multicentric off-site image reading for incidental findings. Scientific analysis will be pursued on a per-project hypothesis-driven basis. CONCLUSION: Population-based whole-body MR imaging as part of the German National Cohort will serve to compile a comprehensive image repository, will provide insight into physiologic variants and subclinical disease burden, and has the potential to enable identification of novel imaging biomarkers of risk.},

METHODS: Framingham Offspring participants underwent brain MRI and neuropsychological assessment at baseline (n=1049) and follow-up (n=561). Participants were classified at baseline and at follow-up as cognitively normal or MCI using sensitive neuropsychological criteria. White matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume, covert brain infarcts, hippocampal volume, and total cerebral brain volume were quantified. RESULTS: Baseline measures of WMH and hippocampal volume were associated with MCI status cross-sectionally and also with conversion from normal cognition to MCI at 6.5-year follow-up. Annualized change rates in total cerebral brain volume and hippocampal volume were associated with conversion from normal cognition to MCI to follow-up. DISCUSSION: Baseline WMH and hippocampal volume are markers that are both associated with conversion from normal cognition to MCI, highlighting the role of both vascular lesions and neurodegeneration in MCI.

Here we analyse fMRI correlations to directly test connectivity within and from the brainstem. Resting and task functional MRI (fMRI) were acquired for 45 ME/CFS (Fukuda criteria) and 27 healthy controls (HC). We selected limited brainstem reticular activation system (RAS) regions-of-interest (ROIs) based on previous structural MRI findings in a different ME/CFS cohort (bilateral rostral medulla and midbrain cuneiform nucleus), the dorsal Raphe nucleus, and two subcortical ROIs (hippocampus subiculum and thalamus intralaminar nucleus) reported to have rich brainstem connections. When HC and ME/CFS were analysed separately, significant correlations were detected for both groups during both rest and task, with stronger correlations during task than rest. In ME/CFS, connections were absent between medulla and midbrain nuclei, although hippocampal connections with these nuclei were enhanced. When corresponding correlations from HC and ME/CFS were compared, ME/CFS connectivity deficits were detected within the brainstem between the medulla and cuneiform nucleus and between the brainstem and hippocampus and intralaminar thalamus, but only during task. In CFS/ME, weaker connectivity between some RAS nuclei was associated with increased symptom severity. RAS neuron oscillatory signals facilitate coherence in thalamo-cortical oscillations. Brainstem RAS connectivity deficits can explain autonomic changes and diminish cortical oscillatory coherence which can impair attention, memory, cognitive function, sleep quality and muscle tone, all symptoms of ME/CFS.},

Change in R/L ratio between visits in AD patients was significant (p = 0.02). The AD group had significantly higher variance in these ratios than the controls at baseline (p = 0.02), but not repeat (p = 0.06). AD patients had higher atrophy rates than controls (p {$<$} 0.001). Mean (CI) annualized atrophy rates for left and right hippocampi were 1.2\% (0.5{\textendash}1.8\%) and 1.1\% (0.5{\textendash}1.8\%) for the controls, and 4.6\% (3.3{\textendash}6.0\%) and 6.3\% (4.9{\textendash}7.8\%) for AD subjects. There was no significant asymmetry in atrophy rates in controls (p = 0.9), but borderline significantly higher atrophy rates in the right hippocampus of the AD group (p = 0.05) compared to the left.

  abstract = {The prevalence of overweight and obesity is increasing worldwide, and the evidence base for a link between obesity and cancer is growing. In the United States, approximately 85,000 new cancer cases per year are related to obesity. Recent research has found that as the body mass index increases by 5~kg/m2, cancer mortality increases by 10\%. Additionally, studies of patients who have had bariatric surgery for weight loss report reductions in cancer incidence and mortality, particularly for women. The goal of this review is to provide an update of recent research, with a focus on epidemiologic studies on the link between obesity and cancer. In addition, we will briefly review hypothesized mechanisms underlying the relationship between obesity and cancer. High priorities for future research involve additional work on the underlying mechanisms, and trials to examine the effect of lifestyle behavior change and weight loss interventions on cancer and intermediate biomarkers.}

  abstract = {It now appears that, in most obese patients, obesity is associated with a low-grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) resulting from chronic activation of the innate immune system and which can subsequently lead to insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and even diabetes. WAT is the physiological site of energy storage as lipids. In addition, it has been more recently recognized as an active participant in numerous physiological and pathophysiological processes. In obesity, WAT is characterized by an increased production and secretion of a wide range of inflammatory molecules including TNF-alpha and interleukin-6 (IL-6), which may have local effects on WAT physiology but also systemic effects on other organs. Recent data indicate that obese WAT is infiltrated by macrophages, which may be a major source of locally-produced pro-inflammatory cytokines. Interestingly, weight loss is associated with a reduction in the macrophage infiltration of WAT and an improvement of the inflammatory profile of gene expression. Several factors derived not only from adipocytes but also from infiltrated macrophages probably contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance. Most of them are overproduced during obesity, including leptin, TNF-alpha, IL-6 and resistin. Conversely, expression and plasma levels of adiponectin, an insulin-sensitising effector, are down-regulated during obesity. Leptin could modulate TNF-a production and macrophage activation. TNF-a is overproduced in adipose tissue of several rodent models of obesity and has an important role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in these species. However, its actual involvement in glucose metabolism disorders in humans remains controversial. IIL-6 production by human adipose tissue increases during obesity. It may induce hepatic CRP synthesis and may promote the onset of cardiovascular complications. Both TNF-a and IL-6 can alter insulin sensitivity by triggering different key steps in the insulin signalling pathway. In rodents, resistin can induce insulin resistance, while its implication in the control of insulin sensitivity is still a matter of debate in humans. Adiponectin is highly expressed in WAT, and circulating adiponectin levels are decreased in subjects with obesity-related insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. Adiponectin inhibits liver neoglucogenesis and promotes fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle. In addition, adiponectin counteracts the pro-inflammatory effects of TNF-a on the arterial wall and probably protects against the development of arteriosclerosis. In obesity, the pro-inflammatory effects of cytokines through intracellular signalling pathways involve the NF-kappa B and JNK systems. Genetic or pharmacological manipulations of these effectors of the inflammatory response have been shown to modulate insulin sensitivity in different animal models. In humans, it has been suggested that the improved glucose tolerance observed in the presence of thiazolidinediones or statins is likely related to their anti-inflammatory properties. Thus, it can be considered that obesity corresponds to a sub-clinical inflammatory condition that promotes the production of pro-inflammatory factors involved in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance.},

  abstract = {Motivation : A vast literature from the past decade is devoted to relating gene profiles and subject survival or time to cancer recurrence. Biomarker discovery from high-dimensional data, such as transcriptomic or single nucleotide polymorphism profiles, is a major challenge in the search for more precise diagnoses. The proportional hazard regression model suggested by Cox (1972), to study the relationship between the time to event and a set of covariates in the presence of censoring is the most commonly used model for the analysis of survival data. However, like multivariate regression, it supposes that more observations than variables, complete data, and not strongly correlated variables are available. In practice, when dealing with high-dimensional data, these constraints are crippling. Collinearity gives rise to issues of over-fitting and model misidentification. Variable selection can improve the estimation accuracy by effectively identifying the subset of relevant predictors and enhance the model interpretability with parsimonious representation. To deal with both collinearity and variable selection issues, many methods based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator penalized Cox proportional hazards have been proposed since the reference paper of Tibshirani. Regularization could also be performed using dimension reduction as is the case with partial least squares (PLS) regression. We propose two original algorithms named sPLSDR and its non-linear kernel counterpart DKsPLSDR, by using sparse PLS regression (sPLS) based on deviance residuals. We compared their predicting performance with state-of-the-art algorithms on both simulated and real reference benchmark datasets. Results : sPLSDR and DKsPLSDR compare favorably with other methods in their computational time, prediction and selectivity, as indicated by results based on benchmark datasets. Moreover, in the framework of PLS regression, they feature other useful tools, including biplots representation, or the ability to deal with missing data. Therefore, we view them as a useful addition to the toolbox of estimation and prediction methods for the widely used Cox's model in the high-dimensional and low-sample size settings.

  abstract = {There is a great deal of heterogeneity in the impact of aging on cognition and cerebral functioning. One potential factor contributing to individual differences among the elderly is the cognitive reserve, which designates the partial protection from the deleterious effects of aging that lifetime experience provides. Neuroimaging studies examining task-related activation in elderly people suggested that cognitive reserve takes the form of more efficient use of brain networks and/or greater ability to recruit alternative networks to compensate for age-related cerebral changes. In this exploratory multi-center study, we examined the relationships between cognitive reserve, as measured by education and verbal intelligence, and cerebral metabolism at rest (FDG-PET) in a sample of 74 healthy older participants. Higher degree of education and verbal intelligence was associated with less metabolic activity in the right posterior temporoparietal cortex and the left anterior intraparietal sulcus. Functional connectivity analyses of resting-state fMRI images in a subset of 41 participants indicated that these regions belong to the default mode network and the dorsal attention network respectively. Lower metabolism in the temporoparietal cortex was also associated with better memory abilities. The findings provide evidence for an inverse relationship between cognitive reserve and resting-state activity in key regions of two functional networks respectively involved in internal mentation and goal-directed attention.},

Reliable estimation of prediction errors is challenging {\textendash} especially under model uncertainty {\textendash} and requires independent test objects. These test objects must not be involved in model building nor in model selection. Double cross-validation, sometimes also termed nested cross-validation, offers an attractive possibility to generate test data and to select QSAR models since it uses the data very efficiently. Nevertheless, there is a controversy in the literature with respect to the reliability of double cross-validation under model uncertainty. Moreover, systematic studies investigating the adequate parameterization of double cross-validation are still missing. Here, the cross-validation design in the inner loop and the influence of the test set size in the outer loop is systematically studied for regression models in combination with variable selection.}

This report is a summary of the Association's evaluation, which was presented at the October 2014 WDC meeting. The Association believes there is sufficient evidence to support the link between several modifiable risk factors and a reduced risk for cognitive decline, and sufficient evidence to suggest that some modifiable risk factors may be associated with reduced risk of dementia. Specifically, the Association believes there is sufficiently strong evidence, from a population-based perspective, to conclude that regular physical activity and management of cardiovascular risk factors (diabetes, obesity, smoking, and hypertension) reduce the risk of cognitive decline and may reduce the risk of dementia. The Association also believes there is sufficiently strong evidence to conclude that a healthy diet and lifelong learning/cognitive training may also reduce the risk of cognitive decline.},

Methods We developed a novel magnetic resonance imaging marker based on diffusion tensor imaging, skeletonization of white matter tracts, and histogram analysis. The marker (peak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity [PSMD]) was assessed along with conventional SVD imaging markers. We first evaluated associations with processing speed in patients with genetically defined SVD (n = 113). Next, we validated our findings in independent samples of inherited SVD (n = 57), sporadic SVD (n = 444), and memory clinic patients with SVD (n = 105). The new marker was further applied to healthy controls (n = 241) and to patients with Alzheimer's disease (n = 153). We further conducted a longitudinal analysis and interscanner reproducibility study. Results PSMD was associated with processing speed in all study samples with SVD (p-values between 2.8 ? 10?3 and 1.8~?~10?10). PSMD explained most of the variance in processing speed (R2 ranging from 8.8\% to 46\%) and consistently outperformed conventional imaging markers (white matter hyperintensity volume, lacune volume, and brain volume) in multiple regression analyses. Increases in PSMD were linked to vascular but not to neurodegenerative disease. In longitudinal analysis, PSMD captured SVD progression better than other imaging markers. Interpretation PSMD is a new, fully automated, and robust imaging marker for SVD. PSMD can easily be applied to large samples and may be of great utility for both research studies and clinical use.

The purpose of this work was to systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the association of BP levels with brain volume reduction in humans. Methods: An English Medline, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO search was conducted in June 2012 using the Medical Subject Heading terms `Blood pressure', `Hypertension', `Brain mapping' and `Brain atrophy'. Results: Of the 609 screened abstracts, 28 studies (4.6\%) were included in the qualitative analysis. Twenty-six studies (92.9\%) showed a significant association of higher BP levels and/or hypertension with total and/or regional brain volume reduction, the frontal and temporal lobes being particularly affected. In addition, four other studies reported an association between lower BP levels and brain volume reduction. Due to the heterogeneity of methodology and outcomes, random-effects meta-analyses of the mean difference of brain volume could be performed on only seven studies, with a total of 709 cases with hypertension and 1001 controls without hypertension. The findings showed no between-group difference regarding the whole-gray matter volume (summary mean difference{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}2.42{$\mkern1mu$}cm3 [95\% confidence interval (CI): -2.13 to 6.96]). Conversely, cases with hypertension exhibited lower hippocampus volume compared with controls [summary mean difference{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu-$}0.10{$\mkern1mu$}cm3 (95\% CI: -0.17 to -0.02)]. Conclusion: These findings provide evidence that high BP levels lead to brain volume reduction, specifically in hippocampus, and may be an important factor that contributes to neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease.},

However, their relative evolution over the entire adult lifespan in healthy individuals remains partly unknown during early and late adulthood, and particularly for the PSMD index. Here, we gathered and analyzed cross-sectional diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data from 10 population-based cohort studies in order to establish the time course of white matter water diffusion phenotypes from post-adolescence to late adulthood. DTI data were obtained from a total of 20,005 individuals aged 18.1 to 92.6 years and analyzed with the same pipeline for computing skeletonized DTI metrics from DTI maps. For each individual, MD, AD, RD, and FA mean values were computed over their FA volume skeleton, PSMD being calculated as the 90\% peak width of the MD values distribution across the FA skeleton. Mean values of each DTI metric were found to strongly vary across cohorts, most likely due to major differences in DWI acquisition protocols as well as pre-processing and DTI model fitting. However, age effects on each DTI metric were found to be highly consistent across cohorts. RD, MD, and AD variations with age exhibited the same U-shape pattern, first slowly decreasing during post-adolescence until the age of 30, 40, and 50 years, respectively, then progressively increasing until late life. FA showed a reverse profile, initially increasing then continuously decreasing, slowly until the 70s, then sharply declining thereafter. By contrast, PSMD constantly increased, first slowly until the 60s, then more sharply. These results demonstrate that, in the general population, age affects PSMD in a manner different from that of other DTI metrics. The constant increase in PSMD throughout the entire adult life, including during post-adolescence, indicates that PSMD could be an early marker of the ageing process.}

On the one hand, modern neuroimaging technologies, such as diffusion tensor imaging, can be used to construct structural graphs representing the architecture of white matter streamlines linking cortical and subcortical structures. On the other hand, temporal patterns of neural activity can be used to construct functional graphs representing temporal correlations between brain regions. Although some studies provide evidence that whole-brain functional connectivity is shaped by the underlying anatomy, the observed relationship between function and structure is weak, and the rules by which anatomy constrains brain dynamics remain elusive. In this article, we introduce a methodology to map the functional connectivity of a subject at rest from his or her structural graph. Using our methodology, we are able to systematically account for the role of structural walks in the formation of functional correlations. Furthermore, in our empirical evaluations, we observe that the eigenmodes of the mapped functional connectivity are associated with activity patterns associated with different cognitive systems.}

Using longitudinal cortical thickness measurements from 663 participants in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) study, we demonstrate the presence of additive and multiplicative scanner effects in various brain regions. We compare estimates of the association between diagnosis group and change in cortical thickness over time using three versions of the ADNI data: unharmonized data, data harmonized using cross-sectional ComBat, and data harmonized using longitudinal ComBat. In simulation studies, we show that longitudinal ComBat is more powerful for detecting longitudinal change than cross-sectional ComBat, and controls the type I error rate better than unharmonized data with scanner included as a covariate.}

  abstract = {We derive a new self-organizing learning algorithm that maximizes the information transferred in a network of nonlinear units. The algorithm does not assume any knowledge of the input distributions, and is defined here for the zero-noise limit. Under these conditions, information maximization has extra properties not found in the linear case (Linsker 1989). The nonlinearities in the transfer function are able to pick up higher-order moments of the input distributions and perform something akin to true redundancy reduction between units in the output representation. This enables the network to separate statistically independent components in the inputs: a higher-order generalization of principal components analysis. We apply the network to the source separation (or cocktail party) problem, successfully separating unknown mixtures of up to 10 speakers. We also show that a variant on the network architecture is able to perform blind deconvolution (cancellation of unknown echoes and reverberation in a speech signal). Finally, we derive dependencies of information transfer on time delays. We suggest that information maximization provides a unifying framework for problems in "blind" signal processing.},

According to the ``last-in-first-out'' hypothesis of brain aging late-developing WM tracts may be particularly vulnerable to advanced age. To test this hypothesis we compared age-related changes in association, commissural and projection WM fiber regions using a skeletonized, region of interest DTI approach. Using linear mixed effect models, we evaluated the influences of age and vascular risk at baseline on seven-year changes in three indices of WM integrity and organization (axial diffusivity, AD, radial diffusivity, RD, and fractional anisotropy, FA) in healthy middle-aged and older adults (mean age=65.4, SD=9.0years). Association fibers showed the most pronounced declines over time. Advanced age was associated with greater longitudinal changes in RD and FA, independent of fiber type. Furthermore, older age was associated with longitudinal RD increases in late-developing, but not early-developing projection fibers. These findings demonstrate the increased vulnerability of later developing WM regions and support the ``last-in-first-out'' hypothesis of brain aging.},

Fractional anisotropy (FA), axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity (RD) represented microstructural properties of normal-appearing WM within 13 regions. Cross-sectional analyses revealed age-related differences in all WM indices across the regions. In contrast, latent change score analyses showed longitudinal declines in axial diffusivity in association and projection fibers and increases in anterior commissural fibers.

However, it is not yet known whether insulin sensitivity involves regional changes in gray matter volume. Against this background, we examined the association between insulin sensitivity, cognitive performance, and regional gray matter volume in 285 cognitively healthy elderly men and women aged 75 years from the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study.RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Insulin sensitivity was calculated from fasting serum insulin and plasma glucose determinations using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) method. Cognitive performance was examined by a categorical verbal fluency. Participants also underwent a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain scan. Multivariate analysis using linear regression was conducted, controlling for potential confounders (sex, education, serum LDL cholesterol, mean arterial blood pressure, and abdominal visceral fat volume).RESULTS The HOMA-IR was negatively correlated with verbal fluency performance, brain size, and temporal lobe gray matter volume in regions known to be involved in speech production (Brodmann areas 21 and 22, respectively). No such effects were observed when examining diabetic (n = 55) and cognitively impaired (n = 27) elderly subjects as separate analyses.CONCLUSIONS These cross-sectional findings suggest that both pharmacologic and lifestyle interventions improving insulin signaling may promote brain health in late life but must be confirmed in patient studies.}

Still, their respective contribution in older people remains unclear. The purpose of this study is to assess the topographic distribution of lacunes and determine whether it has an impact on cognitive functions in a sample of non-disabled patients with age-related white-matter changes. Methods: Data were drawn from the baseline evaluation of the LADIS (Leucoaraioisis and Disability study) cohort of non-disabled subjects beyond 65 years of age. The neuropsychological evaluation was based on the Mini Mental Status Examination (MMSE), a modified Alzheimer Diseases Assessment Scale for global cognitive functions, and compound Z scores for memory, executive functions, speed and motor control. WMH were rated according to the Fazekas scale; the number of lacunes was assessed in the following areas: lobar white matter, putamen/pallidum, thalamus, caudate nucleus, internal/external capsule, infratentorial areas. An analysis of covariance was performed after adjustment for possible confounders. Results: Among 633 subjects, 47\% had at least one lacune (31\% at least one within basal ganglia). The presence of lacunes in the thalamus was associated with lower scores of MMSE ({$\beta\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu-$}0.61; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.043), and worse compound scores for speed and motor control ({$\beta\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu-$}0.25; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.006), executive functions ({$\beta\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu-$}0.19; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.022) independently of the cognitive impact of WMH. There was also a significant negative association between the presence of lacunes in putamen/pallidum and the memory compound Z score ({$\beta\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu-$}0.13; p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.038). By contrast, no significant negative association was found between cognitive parameters and the presence of lacunes in internal capsule, lobar white matter and caudate nucleus. Conclusion: In non-disabled elderly subjects with leucoaraisosis, the location of lacunes within subcortical grey matter is a determinant of cognitive impairment, independently of the extent of WMH.}

Variations of independent component analysis (ICA) have been the methods mostly used on fMRI data, e.g., in finding resting-state networks thought to reflect the connectivity of the brain. Here we present a novel data analysis technique and demonstrate it on resting-state fMRI data. It is a generic method with few underlying assumptions about the data. The results are built from the statistical relations between all input voxels, resulting in a whole-brain analysis on a voxel level. It has good scalability properties and the parallel implementation is capable of handling large datasets and databases. From the mutual information between the activities of the voxels over time, a distance matrix is created for all voxels in the input space. Multidimensional scaling is used to put the voxels in a lower-dimensional space reflecting the dependency relations based on the distance matrix. By performing clustering in this space we can find the strong statistical regularities in the data, which for the resting-state data turns out to be the resting-state networks. The decomposition is performed in the last step of the algorithm and is computationally simple. This opens up for rapid analysis and visualization of the data on different spatial levels, as well as automatically finding a suitable number of decomposition components.},

METHODS: Seventy 30- to 60-year-old cognitively normal participants with clinical, neuropsychological, and dietary examinations and imaging biomarkers at least 2 years apart were examined. These included 34 participants with higher (MeDi+) and 36 with lower (MeDi-) MeDi adherence. Statistical parametric mapping and volumes of interest were used to compare AD biomarkers between groups at cross section and longitudinally. RESULTS: MeDi groups were comparable for clinical and neuropsychological measures. At baseline, compared to the MeDi+ group, the MeDi- group showed reduced FDG-PET glucose metabolism (CMRglc) and higher PiB-PET deposition in AD-affected regions (p {$<$} 0.001). Longitudinally, the MeDi--group showed CMRglc declines and PiB increases in these regions, which were greater than those in the MeDi+ group (p(interaction) {$<$} 0.001). No effects were observed on MRI. Higher MeDi adherence was estimated to provide 1.5 to 3.5 years of protection against AD. CONCLUSION: Lower MeDi adherence was associated with progressive AD biomarker abnormalities in middle-aged adults. These data support further investigation of dietary interventions for protection against brain aging and AD.},

However, no reference standards currently exist to quantify individual differences in neuroimaging metrics over time, in contrast to growth charts for anthropometric traits such as height and weight1. Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data (http://www.brainchart.io/). With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories2 of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones3, showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a complex neurobehavioral disorder that has been linked to changes in brain structure and function. However, the impact of obesity on functional connectivity and cognition in aging humans is largely unknown. Therefore, the association of body mass index (BMI), resting-state network connectivity, and cognitive performance in 712 healthy, well-characterized older adults of the Leipzig Research Center for Civilization Diseases (LIFE) cohort (60-80 years old, mean BMI 27.6 kg/m(2) +/- 4.2 SD, main sample: n = 521, replication sample: n = 191) was determined. Statistical analyses included a multivariate model selection approach followed by univariate analyses to adjust for possible confounders. Results showed that a higher BMI was significantly associated with lower default mode functional connectivity in the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus. The effect remained stable after controlling for age, sex, head motion, registration quality, cardiovascular, and genetic factors as well as in replication analyses. Lower functional connectivity in BMI-associated areas correlated with worse executive function. In addition, higher BMI correlated with stronger head motion. Using 3T neuroimaging in a large cohort of healthy older adults, independent negative associations of obesity and functional connectivity in the posterior default mode network were observed. In addition, a subtle link between lower resting-state connectivity in BMI-associated regions and cognitive function was found. The findings might indicate that obesity is associated with patterns of decreased default mode connectivity similar to those seen in populations at risk for Alzheimer's disease.

  abstract = {Obesity is a risk factor for cognitive decline and gray matter volume loss in aging. Studies have shown that different metabolic factors, e.g., dysregulated glucose metabolism and systemic inflammation, might mediate this association. Yet, even though these risk factors tend to co-occur, they have mostly been investigated separately, making it difficult to establish their joint contribution to gray matter volume structure in aging. Here, we therefore aimed to determine a metabolic profile of obesity that takes into account different anthropometric and metabolic measures to explain differences in gray matter volume in aging. We included 748 elderly, cognitively healthy participants (age range: 60 - 79 years, BMI range: 17 - 42 kg/m(2)) of the LIFE-Adult Study. All participants had complete information on body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glycated hemoglobin, total blood cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein, interleukin-6, C-reactive protein, adiponectin and leptin. Voxelwise gray matter volume was extracted from T1-weighted images acquired on a 3T Siemens MRI scanner. We used partial least squares correlation to extract latent variables with maximal covariance between anthropometric, metabolic and gray matter volume and applied permutation/bootstrapping and cross-validation to test significance and reliability of the result. We further explored the association of the latent variables with cognitive performance. Permutation tests and cross-validation indicated that the first pair of latent variables was significant and reliable. The metabolic profile was driven by negative contributions from body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, glycated hemoglobin, C-reactive protein and leptin and a positive contribution from adiponectin. It positively covaried with gray matter volume in temporal, frontal and occipital lobe as well as subcortical regions and cerebellum. This result shows that a metabolic profile characterized by high body fat, visceral adiposity and systemic inflammation is associated with reduced gray matter volume and potentially reduced executive function in older adults. We observed the highest contributions for body weight and fat mass, which indicates that factors underlying sustained energy imbalance, like sedentary lifestyle or intake of energy-dense food, might be important determinants of gray matter structure in aging.},

  abstract = {The food addiction model suggests neurobiological similarities between substance-related and addictive disorders and obesity. While structural brain differences have been consistently reported in these conditions, little is known about the neuroanatomical correlates of food addiction. We therefore aimed to determine whether symptoms of food addiction related to body mass index (BMI), personality, and brain structure in a large population-based sample. Participants of the LIFE-Adult study (n = 625; 20-59 years old, 45\% women) answered the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS) and further personality measures, underwent anthropometric assessments and high-resolution 3T-neuroimaging. A higher YFAS symptom score correlated with higher BMI, eating behavior traits, neuroticism, and stress. Higher BMI predicted significantly lower thickness of (pre)frontal, temporal and occipital cortex and increased volume of left nucleus accumbens. In a whole-brain analysis, YFAS symptom score was not associated with significant differences in cortical thickness or subcortical gray matter volumes. A hypothesis-driven Bayes factor analysis suggested a small, additional contribution of YFAS symptom score to lower right lateral orbitofrontal cortex thickness over the effect of BMI. Our study indicates that symptoms of food addiction do not account for the major part of the structural brain differences associated with BMI in the general population. Yet, symptoms of food addiction might explain additional variance in orbitofrontal cortex, a hub area of the reward network. Longitudinal studies implementing both anatomical and functional MRI could further disentangle the neural mechanisms of addictive eating behaviors.},

In parallel, cross-sectional observations indicate a correlation of head motion with age, psychiatric disease status and obesity, raising the possibility of a systematic artifact-induced bias in neuroimaging outcomes in these conditions, due to the differences in head motion. Yet, a causal link between obesity and head motion has not been tested in an experimental design. Here, we show that a change in body mass index (i.e., weight loss after bariatric surgery) systematically decreases head motion during MRI. In this setting, reduced imaging artifacts due to lower head motion might result in biased estimates of neural differences induced by changes in BMI. Overall, our finding urges the need to rigorously control for within-scanner head motion to enable valid results of neuroimaging outcomes in populations that differ in head motion due to obesity or other conditions.}

  abstract = {Diabetes is associated with cognitive dysfunction and an increased risk of dementia. This article addresses findings with brain MRI that may underlie cognitive dysfunction in diabetes. Studies in adults with type 1 diabetes show regional reductions in brain volume. In those with a diabetes onset in childhood, these volume reductions are likely to reflect the sum of changes that occur during brain development and changes that occur later in life due to exposure to diabetes-related factors. Type 2 diabetes is associated with global brain atrophy and an increased burden of small-vessel disease. These brain changes occur in the context of aging and often also in relation to an adverse vascular risk factor profile. Advanced imaging techniques detect microstructural lesions in the cerebral gray and white matter of patients with diabetes that affect structural and functional connectivity. Challenges are to further unravel the etiology of these cerebral complications by integrating findings from different imaging modalities and detailed clinical phenotyping and by linking structural MRI abnormalities to histology. A better understanding of the underlying mechanisms is necessary to establish interventions that will improve long-term cognitive outcomes for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes.}

This increased risk has been attributed to vascular comorbidity, but other mechanisms, such as accelerated ageing of the brain, have also been implicated. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether AD in patients with DM2 is associated with an increased occurrence of vascular lesions in the brain, by increased cerebral atrophy, or a combination of both. METHODS: In total, 29 patients with AD and DM2 and 58 patients with AD and without DM2 were included in the study. Clinical characteristics were recorded, and a neuropsychological examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan were performed. MRI scans were rated for cortical and subcortical atrophy, medial temporal lobe atrophy, white matter lesions, and infarcts. RESULTS: The neuropsychological profiles of the two groups were identical. Patients with AD and DM2 had increased cortical atrophy on MRI (p{$<$}0.05) compared with the non-DM2 group. In addition, infarcts were more common (odds ratio 2.4; 95\% CI 0.8 to 7.8), but this effect did not account for the increased atrophy. The other MR measures did not differ between the groups. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that non-vascular mechanisms, leading to increased cortical atrophy, are also involved in the increased risk of AD in DM2.},

We assessed its predictive ability in a population-based cohort of French elderly. METHODS: The sample comprised 6913 subjects from the 3C Study, aged 65 to 84 at baseline, who were followed up to 6 years. Predictive accuracy of the original Framingham stroke risk function was assessed in a 3-step procedure: comparison between the Framingham and 3C cohorts of the prevalence of selected risk factors and the associated relative risks (RR) for stroke, comparison of the predicted to the observed number of stroke events (calibration), and ability to separate high-risk from low-risk participants (discrimination). We also compared predictive performances of the original Framingham, the recalibrated Framingham, and the local stroke risk functions. RESULTS: During follow-up, 110 incident strokes occurred. For most risk factors, RRs were comparable between the 2 cohorts, except for age in women. The original Framingham stroke risk function applied to the 3C cohort overestimated the 6-year absolute risk for stroke by a factor of 3.7 for men and 4.4 for women. However, the recalibrated Framingham and 3C functions did not show any over- or underestimation of stroke risk. The 3 stroke risk functions (original, recalibrated, and 3C) provided acceptable discrimination with areas under the ROC curve ranging from 0.67 to 0.73. CONCLUSIONS: The original Framingham stroke risk function strongly overestimated the stroke risk for 3C participants. Derived Framingham stroke score sheets should not be directly used by physicians in the French elderly population.},

  abstract = {Although it is being successfully implemented for exploration of the genome, discovery science has eluded the functional neuroimaging community. The core challenge remains the development of common paradigms for interrogating the myriad functional systems in the brain without the constraints of a priori hypotheses. Resting-state functional MRI (R-fMRI) constitutes a candidate approach capable of addressing this challenge. Imaging the brain during rest reveals large-amplitude spontaneous low-frequency ({$<$}0.1 Hz) fluctuations in the fMRI signal that are temporally correlated across functionally related areas. Referred to as functional connectivity, these correlations yield detailed maps of complex neural systems, collectively constituting an individual's "functional connectome." Reproducibility across datasets and individuals suggests the functional connectome has a common architecture, yet each individual's functional connectome exhibits unique features, with stable, meaningful interindividual differences in connectivity patterns and strengths. Comprehensive mapping of the functional connectome, and its subsequent exploitation to discern genetic influences and brain-behavior relationships, will require multicenter collaborative datasets. Here we initiate this endeavor by gathering R-fMRI data from 1,414 volunteers collected independently at 35 international centers. We demonstrate a universal architecture of positive and negative functional connections, as well as consistent loci of inter-individual variability. Age and sex emerged as significant determinants. These results demonstrate that independent R-fMRI datasets can be aggregated and shared. High-throughput R-fMRI can provide quantitative phenotypes for molecular genetic studies and biomarkers of developmental and pathological processes in the brain.

  abstract = {Although the brain has been considered an insulin-insensitive organ, recent reports on the location of insulin and its receptors in the brain have introduced new ways of considering this hormone responsible for several functions. The origin of insulin in the brain has been explained from peripheral or central sources, or both. Regardless of whether insulin is of peripheral origin or produced in the brain, this hormone may act through its own receptors present in the brain. The molecular events through which insulin functions in the brain are the same as those operating in the periphery. However, certain insulin actions are different in the central nervous system, such as hormone-induced glucose uptake due to a low insulin-sensitive GLUT-4 activity, and because of the predominant presence of GLUT-1 and GLUT-3. In addition, insulin in the brain contributes to the control of nutrient homeostasis, reproduction, cognition, and memory, as well as to neurotrophic, neuromodulatory, and neuroprotective effects. Alterations of these functional activities may contribute to the manifestation of several clinical entities, such as central insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and Alzheimer's disease (AD). A close association between T2DM and AD has been reported, to the extent that AD is twice more frequent in diabetic patients, and some authors have proposed the name ``type 3 diabetes'' for this association. There are links between AD and T2DM through mitochondrial alterations and oxidative stress, altered energy and glucose metabolism, cholesterol modifications, dysfunctional protein O-GlcNAcylation, formation of amyloid plaques, altered A{$\beta$} metabolism, and tau hyperphosphorylation. Advances in the knowledge of preclinical AD and T2DM may be a major stimulus for the development of treatment for preventing the pathogenic events of these disorders, mainly those focused on reducing brain insulin resistance, which is seems to be a common ground for both pathological entities.}

  abstract = {The worldwide obesity epidemic has become a major health concern, because it contributes to higher mortality due to an increased risk for noncommunicable diseases including cardiovascular diseases, type~2 diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders and some cancers. Insulin resistance may link accumulation of adipose tissue in obesity to metabolic diseases, although the underlying mechanisms are not completely understood. In the past decades, data from human studies and transgenic animal models strongly suggested correlative, but also causative associations between activation of proinflammatory pathways and insulin resistance. Particularly chronic inflammation in adipose tissue seems to play an important role in the development of obesity-related insulin resistance. On the other hand, adipose tissue inflammation has been shown to be essential for healthy adipose tissue expansion and remodelling. However, whether adipose tissue inflammation represents a consequence or a cause of impaired insulin sensitivity remains an open question. A better understanding of the molecular pathways linking excess adipose tissue storage to chronic inflammation and insulin resistance may provide the basis for the future development of anti-inflammatory treatment strategies to improve adverse metabolic consequences of obesity. In this review, potential mechanisms of adipose tissue inflammation and how adipose tissue inflammation may cause insulin resistance are discussed.CrP, C-reactive protein; Csf-1, colony stimulating factor-1; ER, endoplasmatic reticulum; FFA, free (non-esterified) fatty acids; HIF, hypoxia inducible factor; IKK{$\beta$}, I{$\kappa$}B kinase-{$\beta$}; IL, interleukin; Inkt, invariant natural killer T; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; LPS, lipopolysaccharide; MCP-1, monocyte-chemotactic-protein-1; NF-{$\kappa$}B, nuclear factor {$\kappa$}B; NK, natural killer; NLRP3, NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain containing-3; PAI-1, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1; ROS, reactive oxygen species; SC, subcutaneous; TLR, Toll-like receptor; TNF-{$\alpha$}, tumour necrosis factor {$\alpha$}; UPR, unfolded protein response}

  abstract = {Aim: Reports on resting brain activity in healthy controls have described a default-mode network (DMN) and important differences in DMN connectivity have emerged for several psychiatric conditions. No study to date, however, has investigated resting-state DMN in relatively early depression before years of medication treatment. The objective of the present study was, therefore, to investigate the DMN in patients seeking help from specialized mental health services for the first time for symptoms of depression. Methods: Fourteen depressed subjects and 15 matched controls were scanned using 4-T functional magnetic resonance imaging while resting with eyes closed. All but one subject was medication free. A precuneus/posterior cingulate cortex (P/PCC) seed-region connectivity analysis was used to identify the DMN and compare study groups in regions of relevance to depression. Results: The P/PCC analysis identified the DMN well in both study groups, consistent with prior literature. Direct comparison showed significantly reduced correlation between the P/PCC and the bilateral caudate in depression compared with controls and no areas of increased connectivity in the depressed group. Conclusions: The present study is the first to investigate resting-state DMN in the early stages of treatment-seeking for depression. Depressed subjects had decreased connectivity between the P/PCC and the bilateral caudate, regions known to be involved in motivation and reward processing. Deficits in DMN connectivity with the caudate may be an early manifestation of major depressive disorder.},

Given that brain atrophy in anorexia nervosa recovers with nutritional improvements and weight gain, it is worth examining how brain structure changes at the other end of the weight spectrum with weight loss. Thus, this study aimed to examine change in cortical thickness and brain volume in 47 patients with severe obesity who participated in no treatment, behavioral weight loss, or bariatric surgery. T1-weighted MRI scans were conducted pre-treatment and approximately four months later. Measures of cortical thickness, gray matter volume, and white matter volume were compared between time points. Despite overall reduction in BMI, there was no significant change in cortical thickness. There was a significant increase in left hemisphere gray matter and white matter volumes across the sample. At baseline and follow-up, there was no relationship between cortical thickness or brain volumes and BMI. This study is the first to examine changes in cortical thickness and brain volume with weight loss in adults with obesity and the findings show partial support for the hypotheses that weight loss results in increased cortical gray and white matter.},

White matter pathology was determined by the extent of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on FLAIR images as well as the magnitude of global fractional anisotropy (FA) based on diffusion tensor imaging. Main effects, interaction as well as sex-stratified generalized linear regression models were used to evaluate the moderating effect of sex on the association of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and obesity with WMH and FA, respectively. Associations of imaging markers with cognitive test results were determined with linear regression models.ResultsHypertension showed stronger associations with more extensive WMH and less FA in women compared to men. Current smoking was associated with more severe WMH in women only. Adjusted for age and education, WMH were not significantly associated with cognitive tests, but higher FA was associated with better performance in motor function in both sexes and with executive functions in men, even after adjustment for cardiovascular risk factors.ConclusionWe observed a stronger association of hypertension and smoking with white matter damage in women, suggesting a higher susceptibility for vascular pathology in women. However, there was no association of WMH with cognition, and FA was associated with executive function tests only in men, suggesting a higher cognitive reserve in women.},

Advances in technologies and collaborative work have led to substantial progress in the identification of common genetic variants that are associated with cSVD-related stroke (ischaemic and haemorrhagic) and MRI-defined covert cSVD. In this Review, we provide an overview of collaborative studies {\textemdash} mostly genome-wide association studies (GWAS) {\textemdash} that have identified {$>$}50 independent genetic loci associated with the risk of cSVD. We describe how these associations have provided novel insights into the biological mechanisms involved in cSVD, revealed patterns of shared genetic variation across cSVD traits, and shed new light on the continuum between rare, monogenic and common, multifactorial cSVD. We consider how GWAS summary statistics have been leveraged for Mendelian randomization studies to explore causal pathways in cSVD and provide genetic evidence for drug effects, and how the combination of findings from GWAS with gene expression resources and drug target databases has enabled identification of putative causal genes and provided proof-of-concept for drug repositioning potential. We also discuss opportunities for polygenic risk prediction, multi-ancestry approaches and integration with other omics data.},

Calcification volume measured with computed tomography (CT) is a valid marker of atherosclerosis. This study investigates associations of atherosclerosis (measured using CT) at four locations with cognition and brain changes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: To quantify calcification volume, 2414 nondemented people from the Rotterdam Study underwent CT of the coronary arteries, aortic arch, extracranial carotid arteries, and intracranial carotid arteries. To assess global cognition and performance on memory, executive function, information processing speed, and motor speed, they also underwent neuropsychological tests. In a random subgroup of 844 participants, brain MRI was performed. Automated segmentation and quantification of brain MRI scans yielded brain tissue volumes in milliliters. Diffusion tensor imaging was used to measure the microstructural integrity of the white matter. Relationships of atherosclerotic calcification with cognition, brain tissue volumes, and diffusion tensor imaging measures were assessed with linear regression models and adjusted for relevant confounders. RESULTS: With larger calcification volumes, lower cognitive scores were observed. When calcification volumes were larger, total brain volumes were also smaller. Specifically, larger coronary artery calcification volumes related to smaller gray matter volumes, and extracranial and intracranial carotid calcification volumes related to smaller white matter volumes. Larger calcification volume in all vessel beds was accompanied by worse microstructural integrity of the white matter. CONCLUSIONS: Larger calcification volume is associated with worse cognitive performance. It also relates to smaller brain tissue volumes and worse white matter microstructural integrity, revealing possible mechanisms through which atherosclerosis may lead to poorer cognition.},

  abstract = {BackgroundWhite matter hyperintensities are an important marker of cerebral small vessel disease. This disease burden is commonly described as hyperintense areas in the cerebral white matter, as seen on T2-weighted fluid attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance imaging data. Studies have demonstrated associations with various cognitive impairments, neurological diseases, and neuropathologies, as well as clinical and risk factors, such as age, sex, and hypertension. Due to their heterogeneous appearance in location and size, studies have started to investigate spatial distributions and patterns, beyond summarizing this cerebrovascular disease burden in a single metric{\textendash}its volume. Here, we review the evidence of association of white matter hyperintensity spatial patterns with its risk factors and clinical diagnoses.Design/methodsWe performed a systematic review in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) Statement. We used the standards for reporting vascular changes on neuroimaging criteria to construct a search string for literature search on PubMed. Studies written in English from the earliest records available until January 31st, 2023, were eligible for inclusion if they reported on spatial patterns of white matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin.ResultsA total of 380 studies were identified by the initial literature search, of which 41 studies satisfied the inclusion criteria. These studies included cohorts based on mild cognitive impairment (15/41), Alzheimer's disease (14/41), Dementia (5/41), Parkinson's disease (3/41), and subjective cognitive decline (2/41). Additionally, 6 of 41 studies investigated cognitively normal, older cohorts, two of which were population-based, or other clinical findings such as acute ischemic stroke or reduced cardiac output. Cohorts ranged from 32 to 882 patients/participants [median cohort size 191.5 and 51.6\% female (range: 17.9{\textendash}81.3\%)]. The studies included in this review have identified spatial heterogeneity of WMHs with various impairments, diseases, and pathologies as well as with sex and (cerebro)vascular risk factors.ConclusionThe results show that studying white matter hyperintensities on a more granular level might give a deeper understanding of the underlying neuropathology and their effects. This motivates further studies examining the spatial patterns of white matter hyperintensities.},

All underwent annual clinical evaluations including detailed cognitive testing for a mean of 7.1 years before death. Clinical diagnoses of AD were established after reviewing all clinical data, blinded to neuropathologic information. Neuropathologic examinations provided measures of CAA, AD pathology, macroscopic infarcts, microinfarcts, and neocortical Lewy bodies. The association of CAA with AD dementia was examined using logistic regression models, and its association with cognitive decline was examined using linear mixed models.Results: CAA was common, present in 78.9\% of participants, and moderately related to AD pathology ({$\rho$} = 0.401, p \&lt; 0.0001). In analyses adjusted for plaques, tangles, and other common age-related neuropathologies, CAA was associated with an increased odds of AD dementia (odds ratio = 1.237, 95\% confidence interval 1.082{\textendash}1.414) and an increased rate of decline in global cognition, perceptual speed, episodic memory, and semantic memory. The associations of CAA with cognitive outcomes were not driven by the presence of capillary involvement.Conclusions: CAA is an important determinant of AD dementia and decline in multiple cognitive systems in old age.AD=Alzheimer disease; CAA=cerebral amyloid angiopathy}

We quantified the contribution of 9 neuropathologies to cognitive loss at an individual level. Methods Participants (n?=?1,079) came from 2 longitudinal clinical?pathologic studies of aging. All completed 2?+?cognitive evaluations (maximum?=?22), died, and underwent neuropathologic examinations to identify Alzheimer disease (AD), other neurodegenerative diseases, and vascular pathologies. Linear mixed models examined associations of neuropathologies with cognitive decline and estimated the proportion of cognitive loss accounted for by each neuropathology at a person-specific level. Results Neuropathology was ubiquitous, with 94\% of participants having 1+, 78\% having 2+, 58\% having 3+, and 35\% having 4+. AD was most frequent (65\%) but rarely occurred in isolation (9\%). Remarkably, {$>$}230 different neuropathologic combinations were observed, each of which occurred in {$<$}6\% of the cohort. The relative contributions of specific neuropathologies to cognitive loss varied widely across individuals. Although AD accounted for an average of about 50\% of the observed cognitive loss, the proportion accounted for at the individual level ranged widely from 22\% to 100\%. Lewy bodies and hippocampal sclerosis also had potent effects, but again their impacts varied at the person-specific level. Interpretation There is much greater heterogeneity in the comorbidity and cognitive impact of age-related neuropathologies than currently appreciated, suggesting an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches that embrace the complexity of disease to combat cognitive decline in old age.

The distribution of neuritic plaques varied widely not only within architectonic units but also from one individual to another. Neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads, in contrast, exhibited a characteristic distribution pattern permitting the differentiation of six stages. The first two stages were characterized by an either mild or severe alteration of the transentorhinal layer Pre-{$\alpha$} (transentorhinal stages I{\textendash}II). The two forms of limbic stages (stages III{\textendash}IV) were marked by a conspicuous affection of layer Pre-{$\alpha$} in both transentorhinal region and proper entorhinal cortex. In addition, there was mild involvement of the first Ammon's horn sector. The hallmark of the two isocortical stages (stages V{\textendash}VI) was the destruction of virtually all isocortical association areas. The investigation showed that recognition of the six stages required qualitative evaluation of only a few key preparations.}

METHOD: A performance based test (Matching Familiar Figure Test, MFFT), a child interview and questionnaire, and parental reports were obtained from 56 overweight children and 53 normal weight children aged 10-18 years. RESULTS: Overweight children responded in a more impulsive way on the MFFT (P {$<$} .01). On the child questionnaire, overweight boys reported more problems with focussing attention (P {$<$} .05) and both overweight boys and girls reported being worse at shifting their attention compared with normal weight children (P {$<$} .05). In particular, overweight boys showed more impulsivity (P {$<$} .05), hyperactivity (P {$<$} .01), and inattention symptoms (P {$<$} .001) as measured via the clinical interview. Parents of overweight children reported an equal amount of impulsivity and hyperactivity symptoms as parents of normal weight children, but scored their children lower on the Conscientiousness personality dimension (P {$<$} .01). CONCLUSION: A subgroup of overweight children appears to have a stronger tendency to act on impulse than normal weight children, and demonstrated an impulsivity prone personality. Hence, overweight children should be screened for impulse control deficiencies. More research is needed to clear out the robustness of gender differences, the existence of a specific personality profile and possibly common underlying mechanisms of childhood obesity and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.},

Older adults having genetic risk for AD show regionally increased functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activity during memory, possibly representing compensation for a genetically induced neural deficit. We investigated whether vascular health risks, which similarly could lead to neuropsychological deficits, also showed increased fMRI activity during a memory task performed by 30 cognitively intact, primarily normotensive older adults (mean age=61). Vascular risk measures included systolic blood pressure (sBP), body mass index (BMI), and total cholesterol. Higher sBP and BMI (but not total cholesterol) were significantly correlated with increased activation in posterior cingulate cortex and frontal, temporal, and parietal regions. In posterior cingulate and parietal cortices, these relationships were evident even within sBP and BMI ranges considered normal, and were independent of hippocampal volume. Our results are similar to those in prior AD risk research, and suggest that fMRI reveals an abnormal response to cognitive processes in cognitively intact older adults with increased vascular risk.},

Cross-sectional volumetric measures of WMH, particularly in the parietal lobes, are associated with increased risk of AD. In the present study, we sought to determine whether the longitudinal regional progression of WMH predicts incident AD above-and-beyond traditional radiological markers of neurodegeneration (i.e., hippocampal atrophy and cortical thickness). Three hundred three nondemented older adults (mean age~= 79.24 {$\pm$} 5.29) received high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging at baseline and then again 4.6~years (standard deviation~= 1.01) later. Over the follow-up interval 26 participants progressed to AD. Using structural equation modeling, we calculated latent difference scores of parietal and nonparietal WMH, hippocampus volumes, and cortical thickness values in AD-related regions. Within the structural equation modeling framework, we determined whether baseline or change scores or both predicted AD conversion, while controlling for several time-invariant relevant variables. Smaller baseline hippocampus volume, change in hippocampus volume (i.e., atrophy), higher baseline parietal lobe WMH, and increasing parietal lobe WMH volume but not WMH in other regions or measures of cortical thickness, independently predicted progression to AD. The findings provide strong evidence that regionally accumulating WMH predict AD onset in addition to hallmark neurodegenerative changes typically associated with AD.},

Relative hippocampal volume did not predict incident dementia when considered alone (HR~=~0.419; P~=~.77) or with the WMH measures included in the model (HR~=~0.302; P~=~.70). Including hippocampal volume in the model did not notably alter the predictive utility of parietal lobe WMHs (HR~=~1.197; P~=~.049).The findings highlight the regional specificity of the association of WMHs with AD.

  abstract = {Objective White matter hyperintensities (WMH), visualized on T2-weighted MRI, are thought to reflect small-vessel vascular disease. Much like other markers of brain disease, the association between WMH and cognition is imperfect. The concept of reserve may account for this imperfect relationship. The purpose of this study was to test the reserve hypothesis in the association between WMH severity and cognition. We hypothesized that individuals with higher amounts of reserve would be able to tolerate greater amounts of pathology than those with lower reserve. Methods Neurologically healthy older adults (n=717) from a community-based study received structural MRI, neuropsychological assessment, and evaluation of reserve. WMH volume was quantified algorithmically. We derived latent constructs representing four neuropsychological domains, a measure of cognitive reserve, and a measure of brain reserve. Measures of cognitive and brain reserve consisted of psychosocial (e.g., education) and anthropometric (e.g., craniometry) variables, respectively. Results Increased WMH volume was associated with poorer cognition and higher cognitive and brain reserve were associated with better cognition. Controlling for speed/executive function or for language function, those with higher estimates of cognitive reserve had significantly greater degrees of WMH volume, particularly among women. Controlling for cognitive functioning across all domains, individuals with higher estimates of brain reserve had significantly greater WMH volume. Conclusions For any given level of cognitive function, those with higher reserve had more pathology in the form of WMH, suggesting that they are better able to cope with pathology than those with lower reserve. Both brain reserve and cognitive reserve appear to mitigate the impact of pathology on cognition.},

We studied the turnover of radioiodinated HDL apolipoproteins, apo A-I and apo A-II, in 15 human subjects with low HDL-C, six with normal plasma TG levels (group 1) and nine with high TG (group 2), and compared them to 13 control subjects with normal HDL-C and TG levels (group 3). The fractional catabolic rate (FCR) was equally elevated in groups 1 and 2 vs. group 3 for both apo A-I (0.313 +/- 0.052 and 0.323 +/- 0.063 vs. 0.245 +/- 0.043 pools/d, P = 0.003) and apo A-II (0.213 +/- 0.036 and 0.239 +/- 0.037 vs. 0.185 +/- 0.031 pools/d, P = 0.006). Thus, high FCR characterized low HDL-C regardless of the presence or absence of HTG. In contrast, transport rate (TR) of apo A-I did not differ significantly among the groups and the apo A-II TR differed only between groups 2 and 3 (2.15 +/- 0.57, 2.50 +/- 0.39, and 1.83 +/- 0.48 mg/kg per d for groups 1 to 3, respectively, P = 0.016). Several HDL-related factors were similar in groups 1 and 2 but differed in group 3, as with FCR, including the ratio of lipoprotein lipase to hepatic lipase activity (LPL/HL) in post-heparin plasma, the ratio of the HDL-C to apo A-I plus apo A-II levels, and the percent of tracer in the d greater than 1.21 fraction. In linear regression analysis HDL-C levels correlated inversely with the FCR of apo A-I and apo A-II (r = -0.74, P less than 0.0001 for both). Major correlates of FCR were HDL-C/apo A-I + apo A-II, LPL/HL, and plasma TG levels. We hypothesize that lipase activity and plasma TG affect HDL composition which modulates FCR, which in turn regulates HDL-C. Thus, HTG is only one of several factors which may contribute to elevated FCR and low HDL-C. Given the relationship of altered HDL composition with high FCR and low HDL-C levels, factors affecting HDL composition may increase atherosclerosis susceptibility.}

  abstract = {Background White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are a highly prevalent MRI marker of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), which predict stroke and dementia risk, and are being increasingly used as a surrogate marker in clinical trials. However, the influence of study population selection on WMH progression rate has not been studied and the effect of individual patient factors for WMH growth are not fully understood. Methods We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature on progression of WMHs in longitudinal studies to determine rates of WMH growth, and how these varied according to population characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors. We used these data to calculate necessary sample sizes for clinical trials using WMH as an endpoint. Results WMH growth rate was highest in SVD (2.50cc/year), intermediate in unselected stroke patients (1.29cc/year) and lower in patients with non-stroke cardiovascular disease, and with cognitive impairment. Age was significantly associated with progression (correlation coefficient 0.15cc/year, 95\% CI 0.02 to 0.28cc/year) as was baseline lesion volume (0.6cc/year, 95\% CI 0.13 to 1.06 cc/year). Both hypertension (OR 1.72, 95\% CI 1.19 to 2.46) and current smoking (OR 1.48, 95\% CI 1.02 to 2.16) were associated with WMH growth. Sample sizes for a clinical trial varied greatly with patient population selection and baseline lesion volume; estimates are provided. Conclusions WMH progression varies markedly according to the characteristics of the population being studied and this will have a major impact on sample sizes required in a clinical trial. Our sample size estimates provide data for planning clinical trials using WMH as an outcome measure. PROSPERO registration number CRD42020191781.},

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are commonly detected in the brain of elderly individuals and have been associated with a negative impact on multiple cognitive domains. We aim to investigate the impact of global and regional distribution of WMH on episodic memory and executive function in middle-aged cognitively unimpaired participants [N\,=\,561 (45{\textendash}75~years)] enriched for Alzheimer's disease risk factors. WMH were automatically segmented from FLAIR, T1 and FSE MR images. WMH load was calculated both globally and regionally. At each cerebral lobe, regional WMH load was measured at four equidistant layers extending from the lateral ventricles to juxtacortical areas. Cognition was measured by The Memory Binding Test (MBT) and WAIS-IV subtests. Global composite z-scores were calculated for the two cognitive domains. Association between global and regional WMH measurements were sought against cognitive measures, both in global composite scores and in individual subtests. We adjusted cognition and WMH burden for the main sociodemographic (age, sex and education) and genetic factors (APOE-{$\epsilon$}4). Memory and executive function were significantly associated with global WMH load. Regionally, lower executive performance was mainly associated with higher deep WMH load in frontal areas and, to a lower degree, in occipital, parietal and temporal regions. Lower episodic memory performance was correlated with higher WMH burden in deep frontal and occipital areas. Our novel methodological approach of regional analysis allowed us to reveal the association between cognition and WMH in strategic brain locations. Our results suggest that, even a small WMH load can impact cognition in cognitively unimpaired middle-aged subjects.}

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with cognitive dysfunction and dementia. Brain imaging may provide important clues about underlying processes. This review focuses on the relationship between T2DM and brain abnormalities assessed with different imaging techniques: both structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), including diffusion tensor imaging and magnetic resonance spectroscopy, as well as positron emission tomography and single-photon emission computed tomography. Compared to people without diabetes, people with T2DM show slightly more global brain atrophy, which increases gradually over time compared with normal aging. Moreover, vascular lesions are seen more often, particularly lacunar infarcts. The association between T2DM and white matter hyperintensities and microbleeds is less clear. T2DM has been related to diminished cerebral blood flow and cerebrovascular reactivity, particularly in more advanced disease. Diffusion tensor imaging is a promising technique with respect to subtle white matter involvement. Thus, brain imaging studies show that T2DM is associated with both degenerative and vascular brain damage, which develops slowly over the course of many years. The challenge for future studies will be to further unravel the etiology of brain damage in T2DM, and to identify subgroups of patients that will develop distinct progressive brain damage and cognitive decline.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: About 5\% of the US population is morbidly obese. This disease remains largely refractory to diet and drug therapy, but generally responds well to bariatric surgery. OBJECTIVE: To determine the impact of bariatric surgery on weight loss, operative mortality outcome, and 4 obesity comorbidities (diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea). DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: Electronic literature search of MEDLINE, Current Contents, and the Cochrane Library databases plus manual reference checks of all articles on bariatric surgery published in the English language between 1990 and 2003. Two levels of screening were used on 2738 citations. DATA EXTRACTION: A total of 136 fully extracted studies, which included 91 overlapping patient populations (kin studies), were included for a total of 22,094 patients. Nineteen percent of the patients were men and 72.6\% were women, with a mean age of 39 years (range, 16-64 years). Sex was not reported for 1537 patients (8\%). The baseline mean body mass index for 16 944 patients was 46.9 (range, 32.3-68.8). DATA SYNTHESIS: A random effects model was used in the meta-analysis. The mean (95\% confidence interval) percentage of excess weight loss was 61.2\% (58.1\%-64.4\%) for all patients; 47.5\% (40.7\%-54.2\%) for patients who underwent gastric banding; 61.6\% (56.7\%-66.5\%), gastric bypass; 68.2\% (61.5\%-74.8\%), gastroplasty; and 70.1\% (66.3\%-73.9\%), biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch. Operative mortality ({$<$} or =30 days) in the extracted studies was 0.1\% for the purely restrictive procedures, 0.5\% for gastric bypass, and 1.1\% for biliopancreatic diversion or duodenal switch. Diabetes was completely resolved in 76.8\% of patients and resolved or improved in 86.0\%. Hyperlipidemia improved in 70\% or more of patients. Hypertension was resolved in 61.7\% of patients and resolved or improved in 78.5\%. Obstructive sleep apnea was resolved in 85.7\% of patients and was resolved or improved in 83.6\% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Effective weight loss was achieved in morbidly obese patients after undergoing bariatric surgery. A substantial majority of patients with diabetes, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and obstructive sleep apnea experienced complete resolution or improvement.},

We identified 7 networks for analysis, including 4 cognitive networks (default, salience, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal control) and 3 noncognitive networks (primary visual, extrastriate visual, motor). Using linear and curvilinear mixed models, we used baseline connectivity in these networks to predict longitudinal changes in preclinical Alzheimer cognitive composite (PACC) performance, both alone and interacting with A{$\beta$} burden. Median neuropsychological follow-up was 3 years.Results: Baseline connectivity in the default, salience, and control networks predicted longitudinal PACC decline, unlike connectivity in the dorsal attention and all noncognitive networks. Default, salience, and control network connectivity was also synergistic with A{$\beta$} burden in predicting decline, with combined higher A{$\beta$} and lower connectivity predicting the steepest curvilinear decline in PACC performance.Conclusions: In clinically normal older adults, lower functional connectivity predicted more rapid decline in PACC scores over time, particularly when coupled with increased A{$\beta$} burden. Among examined networks, default, salience, and control networks were the strongest predictors of rate of change in PACC scores, with the inflection point of greatest decline beyond the fourth year of follow-up. These results suggest that rs-fcMRI may be a useful predictor of early, AD-related cognitive decline in clinical research settings.A{$\beta$}={$\beta$}-amyloid; AD=Alzheimer disease; AIC=Akaike information criteria; ANOVA=analysis of variance; BIC=Bayesian information criteria; DVR=distribution volume ratio; FC=functional connectivity; FCSRT=Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test; FLR=frontal, lateral, and retrosplenial tracer uptake; GM=gray matter; HABS=Harvard Aging Brain Study; ICV=intracranial volume; LM-DR=Logical Memory IIa delayed recall; MMSE=Mini-Mental State Examination; MNI=Montreal Neurological Institute; PACC=Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite; PiB=Pittsburgh compound B; rs-fcMRI=resting-state functional connectivity; TBR=template-based rotation analysis; TE=echo time; TR=repetition time}

In total, data from 764 participants were compared across five in vivo imaging methods. Convergence of effects was seen in posterior cortical regions, including posterior cingulate, retrosplenial, and lateral parietal cortex. These regions were active in default states in young adults and also showed amyloid deposition in older adults with AD. At early stages of AD progression, prominent atrophy and metabolic abnormalities emerged in these posterior cortical regions; atrophy in medial temporal regions was also observed. Event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging studies further revealed that these cortical regions are active during successful memory retrieval in young adults. One possibility is that lifetime cerebral metabolism associated with regionally specific default activity predisposes cortical regions to AD-related changes, including amyloid deposition, metabolic disruption, and atrophy. These cortical regions may be part of a network with the medial temporal lobe whose disruption contributes to memory impairment.},

Here we synthesize past observations to provide strong evidence that the default network is a specific, anatomically defined brain system preferentially active when individuals are not focused on the external environment. Analysis of connectional anatomy in the monkey supports the presence of an interconnected brain system. Providing insight into function, the default network is active when individuals are engaged in internally focused tasks including autobiographical memory retrieval, envisioning the future, and conceiving the perspectives of others. Probing the functional anatomy of the network in detail reveals that it is best understood as multiple interacting subsystems. The medial temporal lobe subsystem provides information from prior experiences in the form of memories and associations that are the building blocks of mental simulation. The medial prefrontal subsystem facilitates the flexible use of this information during the construction of self-relevant mental simulations. These two subsystems converge on important nodes of integration including the posterior cingulate cortex. The implications of these functional and anatomical observations are discussed in relation to possible adaptive roles of the default network for using past experiences to plan for the future, navigate social interactions, and maximize the utility of moments when we are not otherwise engaged by the external world. We conclude by discussing the relevance of the default network for understanding mental disorders including autism, schizophrenia, and Alzheimer's disease.},

Separate regions of the cerebellum are connected to distinct cerebral areas, forming a complex topography. In this study we explored the organization of cerebrocerebellar circuits in the human using resting-state functional connectivity MRI (fcMRI). Data from 1,000 subjects were registered using nonlinear deformation of the cerebellum in combination with surface-based alignment of the cerebral cortex. The foot, hand, and tongue representations were localized in subjects performing movements. fcMRI maps derived from seed regions placed in different parts of the motor body representation yielded the expected inverted map of somatomotor topography in the anterior lobe and the upright map in the posterior lobe. Next, we mapped the complete topography of the cerebellum by estimating the principal cerebral target for each point in the cerebellum in a discovery sample of 500 subjects and replicated the topography in 500 independent subjects. The majority of the human cerebellum maps to association areas. Quantitative analysis of 17 distinct cerebral networks revealed that the extent of the cerebellum dedicated to each network is proportional to the network's extent in the cerebrum with a few exceptions, including primary visual cortex, which is not represented in the cerebellum. Like somatomotor representations, cerebellar regions linked to association cortex have separate anterior and posterior representations that are oriented as mirror images of one another. The orderly topography of the representations suggests that the cerebellum possesses at least two large, homotopic maps of the full cerebrum and possibly a smaller third map.}

Supported by functional MRI (fMRI) studies that consistently demonstrate differences in brain response as a function of weight status during exposure to appetizing food stimuli, it has been posited that hedonically driven food intake contributes to weight gain and obesity maintenance. These food reward theories of obesity are reliant on the notion that the aberrant brain response to food stimuli relates directly to ingestive behavior, specifically, excess food intake. Importantly, functioning of homeostatic neuroendocrine regulators of food intake, such as leptin and ghrelin, are impacted by weight status. Thus, data from studies that evaluate the effect of weight status on brain response to food may be a result of differences in neuroendocrine functioning and/or behavior. In the present review, we examine the influence of weight and weight change, exogenous administration of appetitive hormones, and ingestive behavior on BOLD response to food stimuli.}

This review summarizes its effects on developing cerebellar granule cells. The glutamatergic mossy fibre input to cerebellar granule cells exerts a neurotrophic effect on these cells during development. The investigation of potential neurotrophic agents can be carried out using enriched granule cell cultures. Considerable evidence now indicates that glutamate acting on N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors is an important neurotrophic factor that regulates granule cell development. In culture, neurite growth, differentiation and cell survival are all stimulated by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation. The intracellular pathways involved following Ca2+ entry through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor channel are beginning to be elucidated. The cerebellar granule cell culture system may provide an ideal model to investigate the molecular mechanisms involved in long term N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-mediated changes in neuronal function.}

AD subjects included in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative study were classified into subtypes based on standardized values (Z-scores) of hippocampal and regional cortical volumes on MRI with reference to age- and gender-specific norms obtained from 222 cognitively normal (CN) subjects. Baseline and longitudinal changes of clinical characteristics over 2 years were compared across subtypes. Whole-brain-level gray matter (GM) atrophy pattern using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers of the subtypes were also investigated. Of 163 AD subjects, 58.9\% were classified as the ``both impaired'' subtype with the typical hippocampal and cortical atrophy pattern, whereas 41.1\% were classified as the subtypes with atypical atrophy patterns: ``hippocampal atrophy only'' (19.0\%), ``cortical atrophy only'' (11.7\%), and ``both spared'' (10.4\%). Voxel-based morphometric analysis demonstrated whole-brain-level differences in overall GM atrophy across the subtypes. These subtypes showed different progression rates over 2 years; and all subtypes had significantly lower CSF amyloid-{$\beta$}1{\textendash}42 levels compared to CN. In conclusion, we identified four AD subtypes exhibiting heterogeneous atrophy patterns on MRI with different progression rates after controlling the effects of aging and gender on atrophy with normative information. CSF biomarker analysis suggests the presence of A{$\beta$} neuropathology irrespective of subtypes. Such heterogeneity of MRI-based neuronal injury biomarker and related heterogeneous progression patterns should be considered in clinical trials and practice with AD patients.}

Health-related data were collected during face-to-face interviews using standardized questionnaires. The baseline examination included cognitive testing and diagnosis of dementia, and assessment of vascular risk factors, including blood pressure measurements, ultrasound examination of the carotid arteries, and measurement of biological parameters (glycemia, total, high-density lipoprotein and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, creatinemia); 3,442 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were performed in subjects aged 65{\textendash}79. Measurements of ultrasound, blood, and MRI parameters were centralized. Two follow-up examinations (at 2 and 4 years) were planned. \emph{Results:} After exclusion of the participants who had subsequently refused the medical interview, the 3C Study sample consisted of 3,649 men (39.3\%) and 5,645 women, mean age 74.4 years, with a relatively high level of education and income. Forty-two percent of the participants reported to be followed up for hypertension, about one third for hypercholesterolemia, and 8\% for diabetes; 65\% had elevated blood pressure measures (systolic blood pressure {$\geqq$}140 or diastolic blood pressure {$\geqq$}90). The proportion of Mini-Mental State Examination scores below 24 was 7\% and dementia was diagnosed in 2.2\% of the participants. \emph{Conclusion:} Distribution of baseline characteristics of the 3C Study participants suggests that this study will provide a unique opportunity to estimate the risk of dementia attributable to vascular factors.},

  abstract = {Abstract Multisite longitudinal neuroimaging designs are used to identify differential brain structural change associated with onset or progression of disease. The reliability of neuroanatomical measurements over time and across sites is a crucial aspect of power in such studies. Prior work has found that while within-site reliabilities of neuroanatomical measurements are excellent, between-site reliability is generally more modest. Factors that may increase between-site reliability include standardization of scanner platform and sequence parameters and correction for between-scanner variations in gradient nonlinearities. Factors that may improve both between- and within-site reliability include use of registration algorithms that account for individual differences in cortical patterning and shape. In this study 8 healthy volunteers were scanned twice on successive days at 8 sites participating in the North American Prodrome Longitudinal Study (NAPLS). All sites employed 3 Tesla scanners and standardized acquisition parameters. Site accounted for 2 to 30\% of the total variance in neuroanatomical measurements. However, site-related variations were trivial ({$<$}1\%) among sites using the same scanner model and 12-channel coil or when correcting for between-scanner differences in gradient nonlinearity and scaling. Adjusting for individual differences in sulcal-gyral geometries yielded measurements with greater reliabilities than those obtained using an automated approach. Neuroimaging can be performed across multiple sites at the same level of reliability as at a single site, achieving within- and between-site reliabilities of 0.95 or greater for gray matter density in the majority of voxels in the prefrontal and temporal cortical surfaces as well as for the volumes of most subcortical structures.

  abstract = {In multiple sclerosis (MS), monoaminergic systems are altered as a result of both inflammation-dependent reduced synthesis and direct structural damage. Aberrant monoaminergic neurotransmission is increasingly considered a major contributor to fatigue pathophysiology. In this study, we aimed to compare the integrity of the monoaminergic white matter fibre tracts projecting from brainstem nuclei in a group of patients with MS (n~=~68) and healthy controls (n~=~34), and to investigate its association with fatigue. Fibre tracts integrity was assessed with the novel fixel-based analysis that simultaneously estimates axonal density, by means of `fibre density', and white matter atrophy, by means of fibre `cross section'. We focused on ventral tegmental area, locus coeruleus, and raphe nuclei as the main source of dopaminergic, noradrenergic, and serotoninergic fibres within the brainstem, respectively. Fourteen tracts of interest projecting from these brainstem nuclei were reconstructed using diffusion tractography, and compared by means of the product of fibre-density and cross-section (FDC). Finally, correlations of monoaminergic axonal damage with the modified fatigue impact scale scores were evaluated in MS. Fixel-based analysis revealed significant axonal damage {\textendash} as measured by FDC reduction {\textendash} within selective monoaminergic fibre-tracts projecting from brainstem nuclei in MS patients, in comparison to healthy controls; particularly within the dopaminergic-mesolimbic pathway, the noradrenergic-projections to prefrontal cortex, and serotoninergic-projections to cerebellum. Moreover, we observed significant correlations between severity of cognitive fatigue and axonal damage within the mesocorticolimbic tracts projecting from ventral tegmental area, as well as within the locus coeruleus projections to prefrontal cortex, suggesting a potential contribution of dopaminergic and noradrenergic pathways to central fatigue in MS. Our findings support the hypothesis that axonal damage along monoaminergic pathways contributes to the reduction/dysfunction of monoamines in MS and add new information on the mechanisms by which monoaminergic systems contribute to MS pathogenesis and fatigue. This supports the need for further research into monoamines as therapeutic targets aiming to combat and alleviate fatigue in MS.},

There is also evidence that interventions involving physical activity and weight loss may affect brain functional connectivity. In this study, we examined the effects of nearly 10 years of an intensive lifestyle intervention (ILI), designed to induce and sustain weight loss through lower caloric intake and increased physical activity, on resting-state networks in adults with T2DM. We performed a cross-sectional comparison of global and local characteristics from functional brain networks between individuals who had been randomly assigned to ILI or a control condition of health education and support. Upon examining brain networks from 312 participants (average age: 68.8 for ILI and 67.9 for controls), we found that ILI participants (N=160) had attenuated local efficiency at the network-level compared with controls (N=152). Although there was no group difference in the network-level global efficiency, we found that, among ILI participants, nodal global efficiency was elevated in left fusiform gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and pars opercularis of right inferior frontal gyrus. These effects were age-dependent, with more pronounced effects for older participants. Overall these results indicate that the individuals assigned to the ILI had brain networks with less regional and more global connectivity, particularly involving frontal lobes. Such patterns would support greater distributed information processing. Future studies are needed to determine if these differences are associated with age-related compensatory function in the ILI group or worse pathology in the control group.},

This characterization has focused largely on describing age-accompanied differences in specialization at the level of neurons and brain areas. We expand this work to describe systems-level differences in specialization in a healthy adult lifespan sample (n = 210; 20-89 y). A graph-theoretic framework is used to guide analysis of functional MRI resting-state data and describe systems-level differences in connectivity of individual brain networks. Young adults' brain systems exhibit a balance of within- and between-system correlations that is characteristic of segregated and specialized organization. Increasing age is accompanied by decreasing segregation of brain systems. Compared with systems involved in the processing of sensory input and motor output, systems mediating "associative" operations exhibit a distinct pattern of reductions in segregation across the adult lifespan. Of particular importance, the magnitude of association system segregation is predictive of long-term memory function, independent of an individual's age.},

  abstract = {This study tested the hypothesis that mid-life intellectual, physical, and social activities contribute to cognitive reserve (CR). Two hundred five individuals (196 with magnetic resonance imaging) aged 66-88 years from the Cambridge Centre for Ageing and Neuroscience (www.cam-can.com) were studied, with cognitive ability and structural brain health measured as fluid IQ and total gray matter volume, respectively. Mid-life activities (MAs) were measured using the Lifetime of Experiences Questionnaire. Multivariable linear regression found that MAs made a unique contribution to late-life cognitive ability independent of education, occupation, and late-life activities. Crucially, MAs moderated the relationship between late-life cognitive ability and brain health, with the cognitive ability of people with higher MA less dependent on their brain structure, consistent with the concept of CR. In conclusion, MAs contribute uniquely to CR. The modifiability of these activities has implications for public health initiatives aimed at dementia prevention.},

  abstract = {Objective: To identify different white matter hyperintensity (WMH) patterns between 2 hemorrhage-prone cerebral small vessel diseases (SVD): cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and hypertensive arteriopathy (HA). Methods: Consecutive patients with SVD-related intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) from a single-center prospective cohort were analyzed. Four predefined subcortical WMH patterns were compared between the CAA and HA groups. These WMH patterns were (1) multiple subcortical spots; (2) peri{\textendash}basal ganglia (BG); (3) large posterior subcortical patches; and (4) anterior subcortical patches. Their associations with other imaging (cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], enlarged perivascular spaces [EPVS]) and clinical markers of SVD were investigated using multivariable logistic regression. Results: The cohort included 319 patients with CAA and 137 patients with HA. Multiple subcortical spots prevalence was higher in the CAA compared to the HA group (29.8\% vs 16.8\%; p = 0.004). Peri-BG WMH pattern was more common in the HA- vs the CAA-ICH group (19\% vs 7.8\%; p = 0.001). In multivariable logistic regression, presence of multiple subcortical spots was associated with lobar CMBs (odds ratio [OR] 1.23; 95\% confidence interval [CI] 1.01{\textendash}1.50, p = 0.039) and high degree of centrum semiovale EPVS (OR 2.43; 95\% CI 1.56{\textendash}3.80, p {$<$} 0.0001). By contrast, age (OR 1.05; 95\% CI 1.02{\textendash}1.09, p = 0.002), deep CMBs (OR 2.46; 95\% CI 1.44{\textendash}4.20, p = 0.001), total WMH volume (OR 1.02; 95\% CI 1.01{\textendash}1.04, p = 0.002), and high BG EPVS degree (OR 8.81; 95\% CI 3.37{\textendash}23.02, p {$<$} 0.0001) were predictors of peri-BG WMH pattern. Conclusion: Different patterns of subcortical leukoaraiosis visually identified on MRI might provide insights into the dominant underlying microangiopathy type as well as mechanisms of tissue injury in patients with ICH.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is an age-related small vessel disease, characterised pathologically by progressive deposition of amyloid {$\beta$} in the cerebrovascular wall. The Boston criteria are used worldwide for the in-vivo diagnosis of CAA but have not been updated since 2010, before the emergence of additional MRI markers. We report an international collaborative study aiming to update and externally validate the Boston diagnostic criteria across the full spectrum of clinical CAA presentations. METHODS: In this multicentre, hospital-based, retrospective, MRI and neuropathology diagnostic accuracy study, we did a retrospective analysis of clinical, radiological, and histopathological data available to sites participating in the International CAA Association to formulate updated Boston criteria and establish their diagnostic accuracy across different populations and clinical presentations. Ten North American and European academic medical centres identified patients aged 50 years and older with potential CAA-related clinical presentations (ie, spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological episodes), available brain MRI, and histopathological assessment for CAA diagnosis. MRI scans were centrally rated at Massachusetts General Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) for haemorrhagic and non-haemorrhagic CAA markers, and brain tissue samples were rated by neuropathologists at the contributing sites. We derived the Boston criteria version 2.0 (v2.0) by selecting MRI features to optimise diagnostic specificity and sensitivity in a prespecified derivation cohort (Boston cases 1994-2012, n=159), then externally validated the criteria in a prespecified temporal validation cohort (Boston cases 2012-18, n=59) and a geographical validation cohort (non-Boston cases 2004-18; n=123), comparing accuracy of the new criteria to the currently used modified Boston criteria with histopathological assessment of CAA as the diagnostic standard. We also assessed performance of the v2.0 criteria in patients across all cohorts who had the diagnostic gold standard of brain autopsy. FINDINGS: The study protocol was finalised on Jan 15, 2017, patient identification was completed on Dec 31, 2018, and imaging analyses were completed on Sept 30, 2019. Of 401 potentially eligible patients presenting to Massachusetts General Hospital, 218 were eligible to be included in the analysis; of 160 patient datasets from other centres, 123 were included. Using the derivation cohort, we derived provisional criteria for probable CAA requiring the presence of at least two strictly lobar haemorrhagic lesions (ie, intracerebral haemorrhages, cerebral microbleeds, or foci of cortical superficial siderosis) or at least one strictly lobar haemorrhagic lesion and at least one white matter characteristic (ie, severe visible perivascular spaces in centrum semiovale or white matter hyperintensities in a multispot pattern). The sensitivity and specificity of these criteria were 74{$\cdot$}8\% (95\% CI 65{$\cdot$}4-82{$\cdot$}7) and 84{$\cdot$}6\% (71{$\cdot$}9-93{$\cdot$}1) in the derivation cohort, 92{$\cdot$}5\% (79{$\cdot$}6-98{$\cdot$}4) and 89{$\cdot$}5\% (66{$\cdot$}9-98{$\cdot$}7) in the temporal validation cohort, 80{$\cdot$}2\% (70{$\cdot$}8-87{$\cdot$}6) and 81{$\cdot$}5\% (61{$\cdot$}9-93{$\cdot$}7) in the geographical validation cohort, and 74{$\cdot$}5\% (65{$\cdot$}4-82{$\cdot$}4) and 95{$\cdot$}0\% (83{$\cdot$}1-99{$\cdot$}4) in all patients who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was 0{$\cdot$}797 (0{$\cdot$}732-0{$\cdot$}861) in the derivation cohort, 0{$\cdot$}910 (0{$\cdot$}828-0{$\cdot$}992) in the temporal validation cohort, 0{$\cdot$}808 (0{$\cdot$}724-0{$\cdot$}893) in the geographical validation cohort, and 0{$\cdot$}848 (0{$\cdot$}794-0{$\cdot$}901) in patients who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. The v2.0 Boston criteria for probable CAA had superior accuracy to the current Boston criteria (sensitivity 64{$\cdot$}5\% [54{$\cdot$}9-73{$\cdot$}4]; specificity 95{$\cdot$}0\% [83{$\cdot$}1-99{$\cdot$}4]; AUC 0{$\cdot$}798 [0{$\cdot$}741-0854]; p=0{$\cdot$}0005 for comparison of AUC) across all individuals who had autopsy as the diagnostic standard. INTERPRETATION: The Boston criteria v2.0 incorporate emerging MRI markers of CAA to enhance sensitivity without compromising their specificity in our cohorts of patients aged 50 years and older presenting with spontaneous intracerebral haemorrhage, cognitive impairment, or transient focal neurological episodes. Future studies will be needed to determine generalisability of the v.2.0 criteria across the full range of patients and clinical presentations.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE Type 2 diabetes confers a greater excess risk of cardiovascular disease in women than in men. Diabetes is also a risk factor for dementia, but whether the association is similar in women and men remains unknown. We performed a metaanalysis of unpublished data to estimate the sex-specific relationship between women and men with diabetes with incident dementia. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS A systematic search identified studies published prior to November 2014 that had reported on the prospective association between diabetes and dementia. Study authors contributed unpublished sex-specific relative risks (RRs) and 95\% CIs on the association between diabetes and all dementia and its subtypes. Sex-specific RRs and the women-to-men ratio of RRs (RRRs) were pooled using random-effects meta-analyses. RESULTS Study-level data from 14 studies, 2,310,330 individuals, and 102,174 dementia case patients were included. In multiple-adjusted analyses, diabetes was associated with a 60\% increased risk of any dementia in both sexes (women: pooled RR 1.62 [95\% CI 1.45-1.80]; men: pooled RR 1.58 [95\% CI 1.38-1.81]). The diabetes-associated RRs for vascular dementia were 2.34 (95\% CI 1.86-2.94) in women and 1.73 (95\% CI 1.61-1.85) in men, and for nonvascular dementia, the RRs were 1.53 (95\% CI 1.35-1.73) in women and 1.49 (95\% CI 1.31-1.69) in men. Overall, women with diabetes had a 19\% greater risk for the development of vascular dementia than men (multiple-adjusted RRR 1.19 [95\% CI 1.08-1.30]; P {$<$} 0.001). CONCLUSIONS Individuals with type 2 diabetes are at similar to 60\% greater risk for the development of dementia compared with those without diabetes. For vascular dementia, but not for nonvascular dementia, the additional risk is greater in women.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore genetic and lifestyle risk factors of MRI-defined brain infarcts (BI) in large population-based cohorts. METHODS: We performed meta-analyses of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and examined associations of vascular risk factors and their genetic risk scores (GRS) with MRI-defined BI and a subset of BI, namely, small subcortical BI (SSBI), in 18 population-based cohorts (n = 20,949) from 5 ethnicities (3,726 with BI, 2,021 with SSBI). Top loci were followed up in 7 population-based cohorts (n = 6,862; 1,483 with BI, 630 with SBBI), and we tested associations with related phenotypes including ischemic stroke and pathologically defined BI. RESULTS: The mean prevalence was 17.7\% for BI and 10.5\% for SSBI, steeply rising after age 65. Two loci showed genome-wide significant association with BI: FBN2, p = 1.77 {\texttimes} 10(-8); and LINC00539/ZDHHC20, p = 5.82 {\texttimes} 10(-9). Both have been associated with blood pressure (BP)-related phenotypes, but did not replicate in the smaller follow-up sample or show associations with related phenotypes. Age- and sex-adjusted associations with BI and SSBI were observed for BP traits (p value for BI, p ([BI]) = 9.38 {\texttimes} 10(-25); p ([SSBI]) = 5.23 {\texttimes} 10(-14) for hypertension), smoking (p ([BI]) = 4.4 {\texttimes} 10(-10); p ([SSBI]) = 1.2 {\texttimes} 10(-4)), diabetes (p ([BI]) = 1.7 {\texttimes} 10(-8); p ([SSBI]) = 2.8 {\texttimes} 10(-3)), previous cardiovascular disease (p ([BI]) = 1.0 {\texttimes} 10(-18); p ([SSBI]) = 2.3 {\texttimes} 10(-7)), stroke (p ([BI]) = 3.9 {\texttimes} 10(-69); p ([SSBI]) = 3.2 {\texttimes} 10(-24)), and MRI-defined white matter hyperintensity burden (p ([BI]) = 1.43 {\texttimes} 10(-157); p ([SSBI]) = 3.16 {\texttimes} 10(-106)), but not with body mass index or cholesterol. GRS of BP traits were associated with BI and SSBI (p {$\leq$} 0.0022), without indication of directional pleiotropy. CONCLUSION: In this multiethnic GWAS meta-analysis, including over 20,000 population-based participants, we identified genetic risk loci for BI requiring validation once additional large datasets become available. High BP, including genetically determined, was the most significant modifiable, causal risk factor for BI.},

  abstract = {Background: There is growing evidence that long-term, heavy cannabis use is associated with alterations in regional brain volumes. Although these changes are frequently attributed to the neurotoxic effects of cannabis, it is possible that some abnormalities might predate use and represent markers of vulnerability. To date, no studies have examined whether structural brain abnormalities are present before the onset of cannabis use. This study aims to determine whether adolescents who have initiated cannabis use early (i.e., before age 17 years) show premorbid structural abnormalities in the amygdala, hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and anterior cingulate cortex. Methods: Participants (n = 121) were recruited from primary schools in Melbourne, Australia, as part of a larger study examining adolescent emotional development. Participants underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging at age 12 years and were assessed for cannabis use 4 years later, at age 16 years. At the follow-up assessment, 28 participants had commenced using cannabis (16 female subjects [57\%]), and 93 had not (43 female subjects [46\%]). Results: Smaller orbitofrontal cortex volumes at age 12 years predicted initiation of cannabis use by age 16 years. The volumes of other regions (amygdala, hippocampus, and anterior cingulate cortex) did not predict later cannabis use. Conclusions: These findings suggest that structural abnormalities in the orbitofrontal cortex might contribute to risk for cannabis exposure. Although the results have important implications for understanding neurobiological predictors of cannabis use, further research is needed to understand their relationship with heavier patterns of use in adulthood as well as later abuse of other substances.},

  abstract = {Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with heterogeneity in genetics, pathology, and clinical manifestation. Understanding this heterogeneity is particularly relevant for clinical prognosis and stratifying patients for disease modifying treatments. Recently, data-driven methods based on neuroimaging have been applied to investigate the subtyping of neurodegenerative disease, helping to disentangle this heterogeneity. We reviewed brain-based subtyping studies in aging and representative neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia, from January 2000 to November 2022. We summarized clustering methods, validation, robustness, reproducibility, and clinical relevance of 71 eligible studies in the present study. We found vast variations in approaches between studies, including ten neuroimaging modalities, 24 cluster algorithms, and 41 methods of cluster number determination. The clinical relevance of subtyping studies was evaluated by summarizing the analysis method of clinical measurements, showing a relatively low clinical utility in the current studies. Finally, we conclude that future studies of heterogeneity in neurodegenerative disease should focus on validation, comparison between subtyping approaches, and prioritise clinical utility.},

The core eating network is closely adapted from a network that Kaye, Fudge, and Paulus (2009) proposed to explain the neurocircuitry of eating, including a ventral reward pathway and a dorsal control pathway. In a review across multiple literatures that focuses on experiments using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), we first show that neural responses to food cues, such as food pictures, utilize the same core eating network as eating. Consistent with the theoretical perspective of grounded cognition, food cues activate eating simulations that produce reward predictions about a perceived food and potentially motivate its consumption. Reviewing additional literatures, we then illustrate how various factors modulate the core eating network, increasing and/or decreasing activity in subsets of its neural areas. These modulating factors include food significance (palatability, hunger), body mass index (BMI, overweight/obesity), eating disorders (anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating), and various eating goals (losing weight, hedonic pleasure, healthy living). By viewing all these phenomena as modulating a core eating network, it becomes possible to understand how they are related to one another within this common theoretical framework. Finally, we discuss future directions for better establishing the core eating network, its modulations, and their implications for behavior.},

However, different scanning platforms can introduce systematic differences which confound true effects of interest. One may reduce multi-site bias by calibrating pivotal scanning parameters, or include them as covariates to improve the data integrity. New method In the present study we use a source-based morphometry (SBM) model to explore scanning effects in multi-site sMRI studies and develop a data-driven correction. Specifically, independent components are extracted from the data and investigated for associations with scanning parameters to assess the influence. The identified scanning-related components can be eliminated from the original data for correction. Results A small set of SBM components captured most of the variance associated with the scanning differences. In a dataset of 1460 healthy subjects, pronounced and independent scanning effects were observed in brainstem and thalamus, associated with magnetic field strength-inversion time and RF-receiving coil. A second study with 110 schizophrenia patients and 124 healthy controls demonstrated that scanning effects can be effectively corrected with the SBM approach. Comparison with existing method(s) Both SBM and GLM correction appeared to effectively eliminate the scanning effects. Meanwhile, the SBM-corrected data yielded a more significant patient versus control group difference and less questionable findings. Conclusions It is important to calibrate scanning settings and completely examine individual parameters for the control of confounding effects in multi-site sMRI studies. Both GLM and SBM correction can reduce scanning effects, though SBM's data-driven nature provides additional flexibility and is better able to handle collinear effects.},

DESIGN: Meta-analysis with meta-regression. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: PubMed, PsycInfo, and Cochrane databases were searched through 28 February 2014. Articles reporting HRs for incident all-cause dementia, AD and VaD based on published clinical criteria using validated measures of clinical depression or symptomatology from prospective studies of general population of adults were selected by consensus among multiple reviewers. Studies that did not use clinical dementia diagnoses or validated instruments for the assessment of depression were excluded. Data were extracted by two reviewers and reviewed by two other independent reviewers. The most specific analyses possible using continuous symptomatology ratings and categorical measures of clinical depression focusing on single instruments with defined reported cut-offs were conducted. PRIMARY OUTCOME MEASURES: HRs for all-cause dementia, AD, and VaD were computed where possible for continuous depression scores, or for major depression assessed with single or comparable validated instruments. RESULTS: Searches yielded 121,301 articles, of which 36 (0.03\%) were eligible. Included studies provided a combined sample size of 66,532 individuals including 6593 cases of dementia, 2797 cases of AD and 585 cases of VaD. The increased risk associated with depression did not significantly differ by type of dementia and ranged from 83\% to 104\% for diagnostic thresholds consistent with major depression. Risk associated with continuous depression symptomatology measures were consistent with those for clinical thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Late-life depression is consistently and similarly associated with a twofold increased risk of dementia. The precise risk estimates produced in this study for specific instruments at specified thresholds will assist evidence-based medicine and inform policy on this important population health issue.},

Method PubMed-MEDLINE and EMBASE were searched for original articles reporting imaging findings of the brain in adult patients with COVID-19 between January 1, 2020 and October 9, 2020. Abnormal neuroimaging findings were categorized as (1) cerebral microhemorrhages, (2) acute spontaneous intracranial hemorrhage (ICH), (3) acute to subacute infarcts, and (4) encephalitis or encephalopathy. Pooled incidences of neuroimaging findings were assessed using random-effects modeling. Between-study heterogeneity was explored by using the {$\chi$}2 statistic for pooled incidences and the inconsistency index I2. The quality of the studies was evaluated using the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies. Subgroup meta-regression analysis was performed to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Results Twenty-one eligible papers, including 2125 patients, were identified. The pooled incidences of cerebral microhemorrhages, acute spontaneous ICH, acute/subacute infarcts, and encephalitis/encephalopathy were 6.9 \% (95 \% confidence interval [CI], 4.9 \%{\textendash}8.9 \%), 5.4 \% (95 \% CI, 3.1 \%{\textendash}7.6 \%), 24.0 \% (95 \% CI, 16.1 \%{\textendash}31.8 \%), and 3.3 \% (95 \% CI, 1.9 \%{\textendash}4.7 \%), respectively. Substantial heterogeneities were noted for all neuroimaging findings (I2 = 87 \%{\textendash}97 \%). Significant publication biases were present in the pooled incidences. In the subgroup meta-regression analysis, patients with mean or median ages over 65 years showed a significantly lower incidence of encephalitis/encephalopathy (P {$<$} 0.001). Furthermore, studies reported that patients in ICU had significantly higher incidences of cerebral microhemorrhages (P\,{$<$}\,0.001) and encephalitis/encephalopathy (P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Conclusions Considerable incidences of abnormal neuroimaging findings have been reported in patients with COVID-19. Acute to subacute cerebral infarction was the most prevalent neuroimaging finding.},

The scale, investment and organization of it are being compared to the Human Genome Project (HGP), which has exemplified ``big science'' for biology. In line with the trend towards Big Data in genomic research, the promise of the BRAIN Initiative, as well as the European Human Brain Project, rests on the possibility to amass vast quantities of data to model the complex interactions between the brain and behavior and inform the diagnosis and prevention of neurological disorders and psychiatric disease. Advocates of this ``data driven'' paradigm in neuroscience argue that harnessing the large quantities of data generated across laboratories worldwide has numerous methodological, ethical and economic advantages, but it requires the neuroscience community to adopt a culture of data sharing and open access to benefit from them. In this article, we examine the rationale for data sharing among advocates and briefly exemplify these in terms of new ``open neuroscience'' projects. Then, drawing on the frequently invoked model of data sharing in genomics, we go on to demonstrate the complexities of data sharing, shedding light on the sociological and ethical challenges within the realms of institutions, researchers and participants, namely dilemmas around public/private interests in data, (lack of) motivation to share in the academic community, and potential loss of participant anonymity. Our paper serves to highlight some foreseeable tensions around data sharing relevant to the emergent ``open neuroscience'' movement.}

Common variants in the FTO gene are associated with adiposity in children and younger adults as well as with adverse mental health in older individuals. However, it is unclear whether FTO influences longitudinal trajectories of adiposity and other intermediate phenotypes relevant to mental health during aging. We examined whether a commonly carried obesity-risk variant in the FTO gene (rs1421085 single-nucleotide polymorphism) influences adiposity and is associated with changes in brain function in participants within the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging, one of the longest-running longitudinal aging studies in the United States. Our results show that obesity-related risk allele carriers of FTO gene show dose-dependent increments in body mass index during aging. Moreover, the obesity-related risk allele is associated with reduced medial prefrontal cortical function during aging. Consistent with reduced brain function in regions intrinsic to impulse control and taste responsiveness, risk allele carriers of FTO exhibit dose-dependent increments in both impulsivity and intake of fatty foods. We propose that a common neural mechanism may underlie obesity-associated impulsivity and increased consumption of high-calorie foods during aging.}

Combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of these two correlated diseases may improve statistical power to detect novel genetic factors for cerebral small vessel disease, elucidating underlying disease mechanisms that may form the basis for future treatments. Because intracerebral haemorrhage location is an adequate surrogate for distinct histopathological variants of cerebral small vessel disease (lobar for cerebral amyloid angiopathy and non-lobar for arteriolosclerosis), we performed GWAS of intracerebral haemorrhage by location in 1813 subjects (755 lobar and 1005 non-lobar) and 1711 stroke-free control subjects. Intracerebral haemorrhage GWAS results by location were meta-analysed with GWAS results for SVS from MEGASTROKE, using `Multi-Trait Analysis of GWAS' (MTAG) to integrate summary data across traits and generate combined effect estimates. After combining intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS datasets, our sample size included 241 024 participants (6255 intracerebral haemorrhage or SVS cases and 233 058 control subjects). Genome-wide significant associations were observed for non-lobar intracerebral haemorrhage enhanced by SVS with rs2758605 [MTAG P-value (P) = 2.6 {\texttimes} 10-8] at 1q22; rs72932727 (P = 1.7 {\texttimes} 10-8) at 2q33; and rs9515201 (P = 5.3 {\texttimes} 10-10) at 13q34. In the GTEx gene expression library, rs2758605 (1q22), rs72932727 (2q33) and rs9515201 (13q34) are significant cis-eQTLs for PMF1 (P = 1 {\texttimes} 10-4 in tibial nerve), NBEAL1, FAM117B and CARF (P \&lt; 2.1 {\texttimes} 10-7 in arteries) and COL4A2 and COL4A1 (P \&lt; 0.01 in brain putamen), respectively. Leveraging S-PrediXcan for gene-based association testing with the predicted expression models in tissues related with nerve, artery, and non-lobar brain, we found that experiment-wide significant (P \&lt; 8.5 {\texttimes} 10-7) associations at three genes at 2q33 including NBEAL1, FAM117B and WDR12 and genome-wide significant associations at two genes including ICA1L at 2q33 and ZCCHC14 at 16q24. Brain cell-type specific expression profiling libraries reveal that SEMA4A, SLC25A44 and PMF1 at 1q22 and COL4A1 and COL4A2 at 13q34 were mainly expressed in endothelial cells, while the genes at 2q33 (FAM117B, CARF and NBEAL1) were expressed in various cell types including astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and neurons. Our cross-phenotype genetic study of intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS demonstrates novel genome-wide associations for non-lobar intracerebral haemorrhage at 2q33 and 13q34. Our replication of the 1q22 locus previous seen in traditional GWAS of intracerebral haemorrhage, as well as the rediscovery of 13q34, which had previously been reported in candidate gene studies with other cerebral small vessel disease-related traits strengthens the credibility of applying this novel genome-wide approach across intracerebral haemorrhage and SVS.}

However, many of the most commonly used techniques have not been systematically evaluated using a broad range of outcome measures. Here, we provide a systematic evaluation of 14 participant-level confound regression methods in 393 youths. Specifically, we compare methods according to four benchmarks, including the residual relationship between motion and connectivity, distance-dependent effects of motion on connectivity, network identifiability, and additional degrees of freedom lost in confound regression. Our results delineate two clear trade-offs among methods. First, methods that include global signal regression minimize the relationship between connectivity and motion, but result in distance-dependent artifact. In contrast, censoring methods mitigate both motion artifact and distance-dependence, but use additional degrees of freedom. Importantly, less effective de-noising methods are also unable to identify modular network structure in the connectome. Taken together, these results emphasize the heterogeneous efficacy of existing methods, and suggest that different confound regression strategies may be appropriate in the context of specific scientific goals.},

  abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a common condition in patients with diffuse hyperintensities of cerebral white matter (WM) in T2-weighted magnetic resonance images and cerebral small vessel disease (SVD). In MCI due to SVD, the most prominent feature of cognitive impairment lies in degradation of executive functions, i.e., of processes that supervise the organization and execution of complex behavior. The trail making test is a widely employed test sensitive to cognitive processing speed and executive functioning. MCI due to SVD has been hypothesized to be the effect of WM damage, and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is a well-established technique for in vivo characterization of WM. We propose a machine learning scheme tailored to 1) predicting the impairment in executive functions in patients with MCI and SVD, and 2) examining the brain substrates of this impairment. We employed data from 40 MCI patients with SVD and created feature vectors by averaging mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy maps within 50 WM regions of interest. We trained support vector machines (SVMs) with polynomial as well as radial basis function kernels using different DTI-derived features while simultaneously optimizing parameters in leave-one-out nested cross validation. The best performance was obtained using MD features only and linear kernel SVMs, which were able to distinguish an impaired performance with high sensitivity (72.7\%-89.5\%), specificity (71.4\%-83.3\%), and accuracy (77.5\%-80.0\%). While brain substrates of executive functions are still debated, feature ranking confirm that MD in several WM regions, not limited to the frontal lobes, are truly predictive of executive functions.

  abstract = {Previous trials have shown promising effects of intranasally administered insulin for adults with Alzheimer's disease dementia (AD) or amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI). These trials used regular insulin, which has a shorter half-life compared to long-lasting insulin analogues such as insulin detemir. The current trial examined whether intranasal insulin detemir improves cognition or daily functioning for adults with MCI or AD. Sixty adults diagnosed with MCI or mild to moderate AD received placebo (n = 20), 20 IU of insulin detemir (n = 21), or 40 IU of insulin detemir (n = 19) for 21 days, administered with a nasal drug delivery device. Results revealed a treatment effect for the memory composite for the 40 IU group compared with placebo (p {$<$} 0.05). This effect was moderated by APOE status (p {$<$} 0.05), reflecting improvement for APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 carriers (p {$<$} 0.02), and worsening for non-carriers (p {$<$} 0.02). Higher insulin resistance at baseline predicted greater improvement with the 40 IU dose (r = 0.54, p {$<$} 0.02). Significant treatment effects were also apparent for verbal working memory (p {$<$} 0.03) and visuospatial working memory (p {$<$} 0.04), reflecting improvement for subjects who received the high dose of intranasal insulin detemir. No significant differences were found for daily functioning or executive functioning. In conclusion, daily treatment with 40 IU insulin detemir modulated cognition for adults with AD or MCI, with APOE-related differences in treatment response for the primary memory composite. Future research is needed to examine the mechanistic basis of APOE-related treatment differences, and to further assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal insulin detemir.},

Results WMH in the left and right anterior thalamic radiation, forceps major, and left inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus were significantly related to domain-specific impairment, independent of total WMH volume and atrophy. A strategic WMH score based on these tracts inversely correlated with performance in all domains.

  abstract = {Introduction The spatial distribution of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) on MRI is often considered in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with cognitive problems. In some patients, clinicians may classify WMH patterns as ``unusual'', but this is largely based on expert opinion, because detailed quantitative information about WMH distribution frequencies in a memory clinic setting is lacking. Here we report voxel wise 3D WMH distribution frequencies in a large multicenter dataset and also aimed to identify individuals with unusual WMH patterns. Methods Individual participant data (N~=~3525, including 777 participants with subjective cognitive decline, 1389 participants with mild cognitive impairment and 1359 patients with dementia) from eleven memory clinic cohorts, recruited through the Meta VCI Map Consortium, were used. WMH segmentations were provided by participating centers or performed in Utrecht and registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)-152 brain template for spatial normalization. To determine WMH distribution frequencies, we calculated WMH probability maps at voxel level. To identify individuals with unusual WMH patterns, region-of-interest (ROI) based WMH probability maps, rule-based scores, and a machine learning method (Local Outlier Factor (LOF)), were implemented. Results WMH occurred in 82\% of voxels from the white matter template with large variation between subjects. Only a small proportion of the white matter (1.7\%), mainly in the periventricular areas, was affected by WMH in at least 20\% of participants. A large portion of the total white matter was affected infrequently. Nevertheless, 93.8\% of individual participants had lesions in voxels that were affected in less than 2\% of the population, mainly located in subcortical areas. Only the machine learning method effectively identified individuals with unusual patterns, in particular subjects with asymmetric WMH distribution or with WMH at relatively rarely affected locations despite common locations not being affected. Discussion Aggregating data from several memory clinic cohorts, we provide a detailed 3D map of WMH lesion distribution frequencies, that informs on common as well as rare localizations. The use of data-driven analysis with LOF can be used to identify unusual patterns, which might serve as an alert that rare causes of WMH should be considered.},

  abstract = {Objectives Obesity is on the rise in the US and is linked to the development of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Emerging evidence over the last decade suggests that obesity may also adversely affect executive function and brain structure. Although a great deal of research focuses on how diet affects the brain and cognitive performance, no study focuses on how food choice may be associated with brain integrity. Here we investigated how lean and overweight/obese (o/o) adults differed in their food choices and how brain structure and cognition may be associated with those choices. Design As part of an ongoing study on diabetes and the brain, participants had routine blood work and a research MRI, received a battery of neurocognitive tests, and were instructed to keep a 3-day food diary. Results and conclusions The lean group ate more high quality foods and less low quality foods compared to the o/o group. In the o/o group, high quality food choices were associated with orbitofrontal cortex volume. The lean group performed better than the o/o group on neurocognitive measures of executive function, such as the Stroop Interference Test, the Wisconsin Card Sort Test and the Trail Making Test B-A, and on attention and concentration tasks such as the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Taken together, these preliminary data suggest that in obesity poor food choices may be associated with frontal cognitive impairments that may be the result of, or contribute to, decreases in orbitofrontal cortex volume. Therefore, longitudinal studies are warranted to investigate a causal link between food choice and executive functioning.},

  abstract = {Cardiovascular fitness is thought to offset declines in cognitive performance, but little is known about the cortical mechanisms that underlie these changes in humans. Research using animal models shows that aerobic training increases cortical capillary supplies, the number of synaptic connections, and the development of new neurons. The end result is a brain that is more efficient, plastic, and adaptive, which translates into better performance in aging animals. Here, in two separate experiments, we demonstrate for the first time to our knowledge, in humans that increases in cardiovascular fitness results in increased functioning of key aspects of the attentional network of the brain during a cognitively challenging task. Specifically, highly fit (Study 1) or aerobically trained (Study 2) persons show greater task-related activity in regions of the prefrontal and parietal cortices that are involved in spatial selection and inhibitory functioning, when compared with low-fit (Study 1) or nonaerobic control (Study 2) participants. Additionally, in both studies there exist groupwise differences in activation of the anterior cingulate cortex, which is thought to monitor for conflict in the attentional system, and signal the need for adaptation in the attentional network. These data suggest that increased cardiovascular fitness can affect improvements in the plasticity of the aging human brain, and may serve to reduce both biological and cognitive senescence in humans.},

  abstract = {Microglia are resident cells of the brain that regulate brain development, maintenance of neuronal networks, and injury repair. Microglia serve as brain macrophages but are distinct from other tissue macrophages owing to their unique homeostatic phenotype and tight regulation by the central nervous system (CNS) microenvironment. They are responsible for the elimination of microbes, dead cells, redundant synapses, protein aggregates, and other particulate and soluble antigens that may endanger the CNS. Furthermore, as the primary source of proinflammatory cytokines, microglia are pivotal mediators of neuroinflammation and can induce or modulate a broad spectrum of cellular responses. Alterations in microglia functionality are implicated in brain development and aging, as well as in neurodegeneration. Recent observations about microglia ontogeny combined with extensive gene expression profiling and novel tools to study microglia biology have allowed us to characterize the spectrum of microglial phenotypes during development, homeostasis, and disease. In this article, we review recent advances in our understanding of the biology of microglia, their contribution to homeostasis, and their involvement in neurodegeneration. Moreover, we highlight the complexity of targeting microglia for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative diseases.}

  abstract = {Genetic variants responsible for susceptibility to obesity and its comorbidities among Hispanic children have not been identified. The VIVA LA FAMILIA Study was designed to genetically map childhood obesity and associated biological processes in the Hispanic population. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) entailed genotyping 1.1 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the Illumina Infinium technology in 815 children. Measured genotype analysis was performed between genetic markers and obesity-related traits i.e., anthropometry, body composition, growth, metabolites, hormones, inflammation, diet, energy expenditure, substrate utilization and physical activity. Identified genome-wide significant loci: 1) corroborated genes implicated in other studies (MTNR1B, ZNF259/APOA5, XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2), DARC, CCR3, ABO); 2) localized novel genes in plausible biological pathways (PCSK2, ARHGAP11A, CHRNA3); and 3) revealed novel genes with unknown function in obesity pathogenesis (MATK, COL4A1). Salient findings include a nonsynonymous SNP (rs1056513) in INADL (p = 1.2E-07) for weight; an intronic variant in MTNR1B associated with fasting glucose (p = 3.7E-08); variants in the APOA5-ZNF259 region associated with triglycerides (p = 2.5-4.8E-08); an intronic variant in PCSK2 associated with total antioxidants (p = 7.6E-08); a block of 23 SNPs in XPA/FOXE1 (TTF-2) associated with serum TSH (p = 5.5E-08 to 1.0E-09); a nonsynonymous SNP (p = 1.3E-21), an intronic SNP (p = 3.6E-13) in DARC identified for MCP-1; an intronic variant in ARHGAP11A associated with sleep duration (p = 5.0E-08); and, after adjusting for body weight, variants in MATK for total energy expenditure (p = 2.7E-08) and in CHRNA3 for sleeping energy expenditure (p = 6.0E-08).

Therefore, we aimed to examine the functional connectivity of the striatum in excess-weight versus normal-weight subjects and to determine the extent of the association between striatum connectivity and individual differences in food craving and changes in body mass index (BMI). METHODS: Forty-two excess-weight participants (BMI {$>$} 25) and 39 normal-weight participants enrolled in the study. Functional connectivity in the ventral and dorsal striatum was indicated by seed-based analyses on resting-state data. Food craving was indicated with subjective ratings of visual cues of high-calorie food. Changes in BMI between baseline and 12 weeks follow-up were assessed in 28 excess-weight participants. Measures of connectivity in the ventral striatum and dorsal striatum were compared between groups and correlated with craving and BMI change. RESULTS: Participants with excess weight displayed increased functional connectivity between the ventral striatum and the medial prefrontal and parietal cortices and between the dorsal striatum and the somatosensory cortex. Dorsal striatum connectivity correlated with food craving and predicted BMI gains. CONCLUSIONS: Obesity is linked to alterations in the functional connectivity of dorsal striatal networks relevant to food craving and weight gain. These neural alterations are associated with habit learning and thus compatible with the food addiction model of obesity.},

The purpose of this study was to measure the contributions of low frequencies and physiological noise to cross-correlation maps. METHODS: In four healthy volunteers, task-activation functional MR imaging and resting-state data were acquired. We obtained four contiguous slice locations in the "resting state" with a high sampling rate. Regions of interest consisting of four contiguous voxels were selected. The correlation coefficient for the averaged time course and every other voxel in the four slices was calculated and separated into its component frequency contributions. We calculated the relative amounts of the spectrum that were in the low-frequency (0 to 0.1 Hz), the respiratory-frequency (0.1 to 0.5 Hz), and cardiac-frequency range (0.6 to 1.2 Hz). RESULTS: For each volunteer, resting-state maps that resembled task-activation maps were obtained. For the auditory and visual cortices, the correlation coefficient depended almost exclusively on low frequencies ({$<$}0.1 Hz). For all cortical regions studied, low-frequency fluctuations contributed more than 90\% of the correlation coefficient. Physiological (respiratory and cardiac) noise sources contributed less than 10\% to any functional connectivity MR imaging map. In blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid, physiological noise contributed more to the correlation coefficient. CONCLUSION: Functional connectivity in the auditory, visual, and sensorimotor cortices is characterized predominantly by frequencies slower than those in the cardiac and respiratory cycles. In functionally connected regions, these low frequencies are characterized by a high degree of temporal coherence.},

Methods Participants are from The 90+ Study, a population-based longitudinal study of people aged 90+ who are survivors from the Leisure World Cohort Study. We estimated hypertension onset age using self-reported information from The 90+ Study and Leisure World Cohort Study, collected about 20~years earlier. A total of 559 participants without dementia were followed every 6~months for up to 10~years. Results A total of 224 participants developed dementia during follow-up (mean~=~2.8~years). Compared with those without hypertension, participants whose hypertension onset age was 80 to 89~years had a lower dementia risk (hazard ratio~=~0.58, P~=~.04) and participants with an onset age of 90+~years had the lowest risk (hazard ratio~=~0.37, P~=~.004). Discussion Developing hypertension at older ages may protect against dementia. Understanding the mechanisms for this lower risk is important for determining ways to prevent dementia in the very elderly.},

Methods: In this prospective cohort study, we analyzed data from 2,223 healthy workers aged 32 to 62 years at baseline. Medical, psychosocial, and environmental data were collected in 1996 and in 2001. We tested cognitive functions at baseline and at follow-up with word-list learning (four recalls), a Digit{\textendash}Symbol Substitution Test, and a selective attention test. Results: Cross-sectionally, a higher BMI was associated with lower cognitive scores after adjustment for age, sex, educational level, blood pressure, diabetes, and other psychosocial covariables. A higher BMI at baseline was also associated with a higher cognitive decline at follow-up, after adjustment for the above-cited confounding factors. This association was significant for word-list learning. For the changes in scores at word-list learning (delayed recall), regression coefficients were -0.008 {$\pm$} 0.13, -0.09 {$\pm$} 0.13, -0.17 {$\pm$} 0.14, and -0.35 {$\pm$} 0.14 (p for trend \&amp;lt; 0.001) for the second, third, fourth, and fifth quintiles of BMI at baseline when compared with the first quintile. No significant association was found between changes in BMI and cognitive function. Conclusions: Body mass index was independently associated both with cognitive function (word-list learning and Digit{\textendash}Symbol Substitution Test) and changes in word-list learning in healthy, nondemented, middle-aged men and women.}

  abstract = {Head motion (HM) is a well known confound in analyses of functional MRI (fMRI) data. Neuroimaging researchers therefore typically treat HM as a nuisance covariate in their analyses. Even so, it is possible that HM shares a common genetic influence with the trait of interest. Here we investigate the extent to which this relationship is due to shared genetic factors, using HM extracted from resting-state fMRI and maternal and self report measures of Inattention and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity from the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD Symptoms and Normal Behaviour (SWAN) scales. Our sample consisted of healthy young adult twins (N = 627 (63\% females) including 95 MZ and 144 DZ twin pairs, mean age 22, who had mother-reported SWAN; N = 725 (58\% females) including 101 MZ and 156 DZ pairs, mean age 25, with self reported SWAN). This design enabled us to distinguish genetic from environmental factors in the association between head movement and ADHD scales. HM was moderately correlated with maternal reports of Inattention (r = 0.17, p-value = 7.4E-5) and Hyperactivity-Impulsivity (r = 0.16, p-value = 2.9E-4), and these associations were mainly due to pleiotropic genetic factors with genetic correlations [95\% CIs] of rg = 0.24 [0.02, 0.43] and rg = 0.23 [0.07, 0.39]. Correlations between self-reports and HM were not significant, due largely to increased measurement error. These results indicate that treating HM as a nuisance covariate in neuroimaging studies of ADHD will likely reduce power to detect between-group effects, as the implicit assumption of independence between HM and Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity is not warranted. The implications of this finding are problematic for fMRI studies of ADHD, as failing to apply HM correction is known to increase the likelihood of false positives. We discuss two ways to circumvent this problem: censoring the motion contaminated frames of the RS-fMRI scan or explicitly modeling the relationship between HM and Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity.}

A composite metric (HM-PC1), which aggregated these three, was also moderately heritable (h2=42\%). Using a sub-sample (N=35) of the twins we confirmed that mean and maximum translational and rotational motions were consistent ``traits'' over repeated scans (r=0.53{\textendash}0.59); reliability was even higher for the composite metric (r=0.66). In addition, phenotypic and cross-trait cross-twin correlations between HM and resting state functional connectivities (RS-FCs) with Brodmann areas (BA) 44 and 45, in which RS-FCs were found to be moderately heritable (BA44: h2{\textasciimacron}=0.23 (sd=0.041), BA45: h2{\textasciimacron}=0.26 (sd=0.061)), indicated that HM might not represent a major bias in genetic studies using FCs. Even so, the HM effect on FC was not completely eliminated after regression. HM may be a valuable endophenotype whose relationship with brain disorders remains to be elucidated.},

A larger number of VRFs was associated with greater brain atrophy, lower grey matter volume, and poorer white matter health. Effect sizes were small (brain structural R ~2 {$\leq$}1.8\%). Higher aggregate vascular risk was related to multiple regional MRI hallmarks associated with dementia risk: lower frontal and temporal cortical volumes, lower subcortical volumes, higher white matter hyperintensity volumes, and poorer white matter microstructure in association and thalamic pathways. Smoking pack years, hypertension and diabetes showed the most consistent associations across all brain measures. Hypercholesterolaemia was not uniquely associated with any MRI marker.Higher levels of VRFs were associated with poorer brain health across grey and white matter macrostructure and microstructure. Effects are mainly additive, converging upon frontal and temporal cortex, subcortical structures, and specific classes of white matter fibres. Though effect sizes were small, these results emphasize the vulnerability of brain health to vascular factors even in relatively healthy middle and older age, and the potential to partly ameliorate cognitive decline by addressing these malleable risk factors.},

Our data suggest that excessive insulin invokes synchronous increases in levels of Abeta and inflammatory agents, effects that are exacerbated by age and obesity.

The investigation of longer-term administration is necessary to determine whether benefits persist, whether they are similar to benefits provided by regular insulin, and whether either form of insulin therapy affects AD biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The present study aimed to determine whether four months of treatment with intranasal insulin detemir or regular insulin improves cognition, daily functioning, and AD biomarkers for adults with MCI or AD. METHODS: This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial included an intent-to-treat sample consisting of 36 adults diagnosed with MCI or mild to moderate AD. Participants received placebo (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}12), 40 IU of insulin detemir (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}12), or 40 IU of regular insulin (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}12) daily for four months, administered with a nasal delivery device. A cognitive battery was administered at baseline and after two and four months of treatment. MRI was administered for all participants and lumbar puncture for a subset (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}20) at baseline and four months. The primary outcome was change from baseline to four months on a memory composite (sum of Z scores for delayed list and story recall). Secondary outcomes included: global cognition (Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognition), daily functioning (Dementia Severity Rating Scale), MRI volume changes in AD-related regions of interest, and cerebrospinal fluid AD markers. RESULTS: The regular insulin treated group had better memory after two and four months compared with placebo (p{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.03). No significant effects were observed for the detemir-assigned group compared with the placebo group, or for daily functioning for either group. Regular insulin treatment was associated with preserved volume on MRI. Regular insulin treatment was also associated with reduction in the tau-P181/A{$\beta$}42 ratio. CONCLUSION: Future research is warranted to examine the mechanistic basis of treatment differences, and to further assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal insulin. FAU - Craft, Suzanne},

This study examined the effect of standard vs intensive BP treatment on cerebral perfusion in patients with severe small vessel disease.To investigate whether standard vs intensive BP lowering over 3 months causes decreased cerebral perfusion in small vessel disease.This randomized clinical trial took place at 2 English university medical centers. Patients were randomized via a central online system (in a 1:1 ratio). Seventy patients with hypertension and with magnetic resonance imaging{\textendash}confirmed symptomatic lacunar infarct and confluent white matter hyperintensities were recruited between February 29, 2012, and October 21, 2015, and randomized (36 in the standard group and 34 in the intensive group). Analyzable data were available in 62 patients, 33 in the standard group and 29 in the intensive group, for intent-to-treat analysis. This experiment examines the 3-month follow-up period.Patients were randomized to standard (systolic, 130-140 mm Hg) or intensive (systolic, \&lt;125 mm Hg) BP targets, to be achieved through medication changes.Cerebral perfusion was measured using arterial spin labeling; the primary end point was change in global perfusion between baseline and 3 months, compared between treatment groups by analysis of variance. Linear regression compared change in perfusion against change in BP. Magnetic resonance imaging scan analysis was masked to treatment group.Among 62 analyzable patients, the mean age was 69.3 years, and 60\% (n\,=\,37) were male. The mean (SD) systolic BP decreased by 8 (12) mm Hg in the standard group and by 27 (17) mm Hg in the intensive group (P\,\&lt;\,.001), with mean (SD) achieved pressures of 141 (13) and 126 (10) mm Hg, respectively. Change in global perfusion did not differ between treatment groups: the mean (SD) change was -0.5 (9.4) mL/min/100 g in the standard group vs 0.7 (8.6) mL/min/100 g in the intensive group (partial {$\eta$}2, 0.004; 95\% CI, -3.551 to 5.818; P\,=\,.63). No differences were observed when the analysis examined gray or white matter only or was confined to those achieving target BP. The number of adverse events did not differ between treatment groups, with a mean (SD) of 0.21 (0.65) for the standard group and 0.32 (0.75) for the intensive group (P\,=\,.44).Intensive BP lowering did not reduce cerebral perfusion in severe small vessel disease.isrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN37694103},

Disappointing results from clinical trials performed in mild-moderate AD dementia combined with clear epidemiological evidence on AD risk factors are contributing to the development of primary prevention initiatives. In addition, the characterization of the long asymptomatic stage of AD is allowing the development of intervention studies and secondary prevention programmes on asymptomatic at-risk individuals, before substantial irreversible neuronal dysfunction and loss have occurred, an approach that emerges as highly relevant.In this manuscript, we review current strategies for AD prevention, from primary prevention strategies based on identifying risk factors and risk reduction, to secondary prevention initiatives based on the early detection of the pathophysiological hallmarks and intervention at the preclinical stage of the disease. Firstly, we summarize the evidence on several AD risk factors, which are the rationale for the establishment of primary prevention programmes as well as revising current primary prevention strategies. Secondly, we review the development of public-private partnerships for disease prevention that aim to characterize the AD continuum as well as serving as platforms for secondary prevention trials. Finally, we summarize currently ongoing clinical trials recruiting participants with preclinical AD or a higher risk for the onset of AD-related cognitive impairment.The growing body of research on the risk factors for AD and its preclinical stage is favouring the development of AD prevention programmes that, by delaying the onset of Alzheimer's dementia for only a few years, would have a huge impact on public health.}

An important pathophysiological mechanism of cSVD is blood-brain barrier leakage and endothelium dysfunction which gives a clue in identification of the disease through circulating biological markers. Detection of cSVD is routinely carried out by key neuroimaging markers including white matter hyperintensities, lacunes, small subcortical infarcts, perivascular spaces, cerebral microbleeds, and brain atrophy. Application of neural networking, machine learning and deep learning in image processing have increased significantly for correct severity of cSVD. A linkage between cSVD and other neurological disorder, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease and non-cerebral disease, has also been investigated recently. This review draws a broad picture of cSVD, aiming to inculcate new insights into its pathogenesis and biomarkers. It also focuses on the role of deep machine strategies and other dimensions of cSVD by linking it with several cerebral and non-cerebral diseases as well as recent advances in the field to achieve sensitive detection, effective prevention and disease management.},

The protocol presents risk information as cumulative incidence curves. This article describes how these curves were estimated. METHODS: Curves were calculated using Bayes' rule to compute the posterior survival curves incorporating APOE information. RESULTS: A combination of survival data from the MIRAGE study and gender- and age-specific APOE odds ratios were used to create risk curves for males and females within each of the 6 APOE genotypes. CONCLUSION: Utilizing comparative genotype relative risk information and survival data from family studies, estimates of gender-, age-, and genotype-specific risk can be generated for use in a risk assessment research study that features genotype disclosure.},

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are common in individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease. Patients with MCI with high WMH volumes are known to have an increased chance of conversion to Alzheimer's disease compared with those without WMHs. In this article, we assess the differences between patients with MCI that remain stable (N~= 413) and those that progress to dementia (N~=~178) in terms of WMH volume (as a surrogate of amount of tissue damage) and T1-weighted (T1w) image hypointensity (as a surrogate of severity of tissue damage) in periventricular, deep, and juxtacortical brain regions. Together, lesion volume and T1w hypointensity are used as a surrogate of vascular disease burden. Our results show a significantly greater increase of all regional WMH volumes in the MCI population that converts to dementia (p~{$<$} 0.001). T1w hypointensity for the juxtacortical WMHs was significantly lower in the converter group (p~{$<~$}0.0001) and was not affected by age. Conversely, T1w hypointensity in other regions showed a significant decrease with age (p {$<$} 0.0001). Within the converters, Time2Conversion was associated with both WMH volume and T1w hypointensity (p {$<$} 0.0001), and conversion to dementia was significantly associated with decreased intensity (and not volume) of periventricular and juxtacortical WMHs (p {$<$} 0.001). These changes differ according to the WM region, suggesting that different mechanisms affect the juxtacortical area in comparison to deep and periventricular regions in the process of conversion to dementia.},

  abstract = {Introduction White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings in the aging population in general, as well as in patients with neurodegenerative diseases. They are known to exacerbate the cognitive deficits and worsen the clinical outcomes in the patients. However, it is not well-understood whether there are disease-specific differences in prevalence and distribution of WMHs in different neurodegenerative disorders. Methods Data included 976 participants with cross-sectional T1-weighted and fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRIs from the Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND) cohort of the Canadian Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) with eleven distinct diagnostic groups: cognitively intact elderly (CIE), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), vascular MCI (V-MCI), Alzheimer's dementia (AD), vascular AD (V-AD), frontotemporal dementia (FTD), Lewy body dementia (LBD), cognitively intact elderly with Parkinson's disease (PD-CIE), cognitively impaired Parkinson's disease (PD-CI), and mixed dementias. WMHs were segmented using a previously validated automated technique. WMH volumes in each lobe and hemisphere were compared against matched CIE individuals, as well as each other, and between men and women. Results All cognitively impaired diagnostic groups had significantly greater overall WMH volumes than the CIE group. Vascular groups (i.e. V-MCI, V-AD, and mixed dementia) had significantly greater WMH volumes than all other groups, except for FTD, which also had significantly greater WMH volumes than all non-vascular groups. Women tended to have lower WMH burden than men in most groups and regions, controlling for age. The left frontal lobe tended to have a lower WMH burden than the right in all groups. In contrast, the right occipital lobe tended to have greater WMH volumes than the left. Conclusions There were distinct differences in WMH prevalence and distribution across diagnostic groups, sexes, and in terms of asymmetry. WMH burden was significantly greater in all neurodegenerative dementia groups, likely encompassing areas exclusively impacted by neurodegeneration as well as areas related to cerebrovascular disease pathology.},

The load and location of WMHs are important clinical measures that may indicate the presence of small vessel disease in aging and Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients. Manually segmenting WMHs is time consuming and prone to inter-rater and intra-rater variabilities. Automated tools that can accurately and robustly detect these lesions can be used to measure the vascular burden in individuals with AD or the elderly population in general. Many WMH segmentation techniques use a classifier in combination with a set of intensity and location features to segment WMHs, however, the optimal choice of classifier is unknown. Methods We compare 10 different linear and nonlinear classification techniques to identify WMHs from MRI data. Each classifier is trained and optimized based on a set of features obtained from co-registered MR images containing spatial location and intensity information. We further assess the performance of the classifiers using different combinations of MRI contrast information. The performances of the different classifiers were compared on three heterogeneous multi-site datasets, including images acquired with different scanners and different scan-parameters. These included data from the ADC study from University of California Davis, the NACC database and the ADNI study. The classifiers (na{\"i}ve Bayes, logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, bagging, and boosting) were evaluated using a variety of voxel-wise and volumetric similarity measures such as Dice Kappa similarity index (SI), Intra-Class Correlation (ICC), and sensitivity as well as computational burden and processing times. These investigations enable meaningful comparisons between the performances of different classifiers to determine the most suitable classifiers for segmentation of WMHs. In the spirit of open-source science, we also make available a fully automated tool for segmentation of WMHs with pre-trained classifiers for all these techniques. Results Random Forests yielded the best performance among all classifiers with mean Dice Kappa (SI) of 0.66{$\pm$}0.17 and ICC=0.99 for the ADC dataset (using T1w, T2w, PD, and FLAIR scans), SI=0.72{$\pm$}0.10, ICC=0.93 for the NACC dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans), SI=0.66{$\pm$}0.23, ICC=0.94 for ADNI1 dataset (using T1w, T2w, and PD scans) and SI=0.72{$\pm$}0.19, ICC=0.96 for ADNI2/GO dataset (using T1w and FLAIR scans). Not using the T2w/PD information did not change the performance of the Random Forest classifier (SI=0.66{$\pm$}0.17, ICC=0.99). However, not using FLAIR information in the ADC dataset significantly decreased the Dice Kappa, but the volumetric correlation did not drastically change (SI=0.47{$\pm$}0.21, ICC=0.95). Conclusion Our investigations showed that with appropriate features, most off-the-shelf classifiers are able to accurately detect WMHs in presence of FLAIR scan information, while Random Forests had the best performance across all datasets. However, we observed that the performances of most linear classifiers and some nonlinear classifiers drastically decline in absence of FLAIR information, with Random Forest still retaining the best performance.},

  abstract = {Functional MRI (fMRI) can be applied to study the functional connectivity of the human brain. It has been suggested that fluctuations in the blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal during rest reflect the neuronal baseline activity of the brain, representing the state of the human brain in the absence of goal-directed neuronal action and external input, and that these slow fluctuations correspond to functionally relevant resting-state networks. Several studies on resting fMRI have been conducted, reporting an apparent similarity between the identified patterns. The spatial consistency of these resting patterns, however, has not yet been evaluated and quantified. In this study, we apply a data analysis approach called tensor probabilistic independent component analysis to resting-state fMRI data to find coherencies that are consistent across subjects and sessions. We characterize and quantify the consistency of these effects by using a bootstrapping approach, and we estimate the BOLD amplitude modulation as well as the voxel-wise cross-subject variation. The analysis found 10 patterns with potential functional relevance, consisting of regions known to be involved in motor function, visual processing, executive functioning, auditory processing, memory, and the so-called default-mode network, each with BOLD signal changes up to 3\%. In general, areas with a high mean percentage BOLD signal are consistent and show the least variation around the mean. These findings show that the baseline activity of the brain is consistent across subjects exhibiting significant temporal dynamics, with percentage BOLD signal change comparable with the signal changes found in task-related experiments.},

Furthermore, it has been noted that the default mode network is not as homogenous as previously assumed and several fractionations of the network have been proposed. Here, we separately investigated the modulation of 3 default mode subnetworks, as identified with group independent component analysis, by comparing Alzheimer's disease patients to healthy controls and by assessing connectivity changes over time. Our results showed decreased connectivity at baseline in patients versus controls in the posterior default mode network, and increased connectivity in the anterior and ventral default mode networks. At follow-up, functional connectivity decreased across all default mode systems in patients. Our results suggest that earlier in the disease, regions of the posterior default mode network start to disengage whereas regions within the anterior and ventral networks enhance their connectivity. However, as the disease progresses, connectivity within all systems eventually deteriorates.},

The exact relationship between structure and function, however, might not be straightforward. In this review we aim to examine how our understanding of the relationship between structure and function in the `resting' brain has advanced over the last several years. We discuss eight articles that directly compare resting-state functional connectivity with structural connectivity and three clinical case studies of patients with limited white matter connections between the cerebral hemispheres. All studies examined show largely convergent results: the strength of resting-state functional connectivity is positively correlated with structural connectivity strength. However, functional connectivity is also observed between regions where there is little or no structural connectivity, which most likely indicates functional correlations mediated by indirect structural connections (i.e. via a third region). As the methodologies for measuring structural and functional connectivity continue to improve and their complementary strengths are applied in parallel, we can expect important advances in our diagnostic and prognostic capacities in diseases like Alzheimer's, multiple sclerosis, and stroke.}

We aimed to assess possible differences of WMH spatial distribution between AD patients and age-matched controls by means of lesion probability maps. Methods: The present study included MRI scans of 130 probable AD patients with a mean age of 73.4{$\pm$}8.2 years from the Prospective Dementia Registry Austria Study and 130 age-matched healthy controls (HC) from the Austrian Stroke Prevention Family Study. Risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hypercholesterolemia, coronary artery disease, and smoking were assessed. Manually segmented FLAIR WMH masks were non-linearly registered to a template and voxel-based probability mapping was performed. Results: There were no significant between-group differences in cardiovascular risk factors and WMH volume. AD patients showed a significantly higher likelihood of having WMH in a bilateral periventricular distribution than controls before and after correcting for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and ventricular volume (p {$\leq$}0.05; threshold-free cluster enhancement corrected). There was no significant association between the periventricular WMH volume and cognitive decline of AD patients. Conclusion: In AD, WMH were preferentially found in a periventricular location but the volume of lesions was unrelated to cognitive decline in our study irrespective of lesion location.},

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities proliferate as the brain ages and are associated with increased risk for cognitive decline as well as Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. As such, white matter hyperintensities have been targeted as a surrogate biomarker in intervention trials with older adults. However, it is unclear at what stage of aging white matter hyperintensities begin to relate to cognition and if they may be a viable target for early prevention. In the Dunedin Study, a population-representative cohort followed since birth, we measured white matter hyperintensities in 843 45-year-old participants using T(2)-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and we assessed cognitive decline from childhood to midlife. We found that white matter hyperintensities were common at age 45 and that white matter hyperintensity volume was modestly associated with both lower childhood ({\ss} = -0.08, P\,=\,0.013) and adult IQ ({\ss}=-0.15, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Moreover, white matter hyperintensity volume was associated with greater cognitive decline from childhood to midlife ({\ss}=-0.09, P\,{$<$}\,0.001). Our results demonstrate that a link between white matter hyperintensities and early signs of cognitive decline is detectable decades before clinical symptoms of dementia emerge. Thus, white matter hyperintensities may be a useful surrogate biomarker for identifying individuals in midlife at risk for future accelerated cognitive decline and selecting participants for dementia prevention trials.},

  abstract = {A challenge in developing informative neuroimaging biomarkers for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease is the need to identify biomarkers that are evident before the onset of clinical symptoms, and which have sufficient sensitivity and specificity on an individual patient basis. Recent literature suggests that spatial patterns of brain atrophy discriminate amongst Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and cognitively normal (CN) older adults with high accuracy on an individual basis, thereby offering promise that subtle brain changes can be detected during prodromal Alzheimer's disease stages. Here, we investigate whether these spatial patterns of brain atrophy can be detected in CN and MCI individuals and whether they are associated with cognitive decline. Images from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were used to construct a pattern classifier that recognizes spatial patterns of brain atrophy which best distinguish Alzheimer's disease patients from CN on an individual person basis. This classifier was subsequently applied to longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging scans of CN and MCI participants in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA) neuroimaging study. The degree to which Alzheimer's disease-like patterns were present in CN and MCI subjects was evaluated longitudinally in relation to cognitive performance. The oldest BLSA CN individuals showed progressively increasing Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, and individuals with these patterns had reduced cognitive performance. MCI was associated with steeper longitudinal increases of Alzheimer's disease-like patterns of atrophy, which separated them from CN (receiver operating characteristic area under the curve equal to 0.89). Our results suggest that imaging-based spatial patterns of brain atrophy of Alzheimer's disease, evaluated with sophisticated pattern analysis and recognition methods, may be useful in discriminating among CN individuals who are likely to be stable versus those who will show cognitive decline. Future prospective studies will elucidate the temporal dynamics of spatial atrophy patterns and the emergence of clinical symptoms.}

More than 200 symptoms have been identified with impacts on multiple organ systems. At least 65 million individuals worldwide are estimated to have long COVID, with cases increasing daily. Biomedical research has made substantial progress in identifying various pathophysiological changes and risk factors and in characterizing the illness; further, similarities with other viral-onset illnesses such as myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome have laid the groundwork for research in the field. In this Review, we explore the current literature and highlight key findings, the overlap with other conditions, the variable onset of symptoms, long COVID in children and the impact of vaccinations. Although these key findings are critical to understanding long COVID, current diagnostic and treatment options are insufficient, and clinical trials must be prioritized that address leading hypotheses. Additionally, to strengthen long COVID research, future studies must account for biases and SARS-CoV-2 testing issues, build on viral-onset research, be inclusive of marginalized populations and meaningfully engage patients throughout the research process.},

  abstract = {Contralateral recruitment remains a controversial phenomenon in both the clinical and normative populations. To investigate the neural correlates of this phenomenon, we explored the tendency for older adults to recruit prefrontal cortex (PFC) regions contralateral to those most active in younger adults. Participants were scanned with diffusion tensor imaging and functional magnetic rresonance imaging during a lateralized word matching task (unilateral vs. bilateral). Cross-hemispheric communication was measured behaviorally as greater accuracy for bilateral than unilateral trials (bilateral processing advantage [BPA]) and at the neural level by functional and structural connectivity between contralateral PFC. Compared with the young, older adults exhibited 1) greater BPAs in the behavioral task, 2) greater compensatory activity in contralateral PFC during the bilateral condition, 3) greater functional connectivity between contralateral PFC during bilateral trials, and 4) a positive correlation between fractional anisotropy in the corpus callosum and both the BPA and the functional connectivity between contralateral PFC, indicating that older adults' ability to distribute processing across hemispheres is constrained by white matter integrity. These results clarify how older adults' ability to recruit extra regions in response to the demands of aging is mediated by existing structural architecture, and how this architecture engenders corresponding functional changes that allow subjects to meet those task demands.}

  abstract = {Growing evidence shows that a significant number of patients with COVID-19 experience prolonged symptoms, known as Long COVID. Few systematic studies exist which investigate this population, and hence, relatively little is known about the range in symptom makeup and severity, expected clinical course, impact on daily functioning, and expected return to baseline health. In this study, we analysed responses from 3,762 participants with confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive; 1,020) or suspected (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested; 2,742) COVID-19, from 56 countries, with illness duration of at least 28 days. 3608 (96\%) reported symptoms beyond 90 days. Prevalence of 205 symptoms in 10 organ systems was estimated in this cohort, with 66 symptoms traced over seven months. Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all symptoms were similar between groups with confirmed and suspected COVID-19. Respondents experienced an average of 14.5 symptoms in an average of 9.08 organ systems. Three clusters of symptoms were identified based on their prevalence over time. The most likely early symptoms were fatigue, dry cough, shortness of breath, headaches, muscle aches, chest tightness, and sore throat. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were fatigue, post-exertional malaise, and cognitive dysfunction. Majority (\&amp;gt;85\%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 1,700 (45.2\%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 839 (22.3\%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.Significance Statement Results from our international online survey of 3,762 individuals with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 illness suggest that Long COVID is composed of heterogeneous post-acute infection sequelae that often affect multiple organ systems, with impact on functioning and quality of life ranging from mild to severe. This study represents the largest collection of symptoms identified in the Long COVID population to date, and is the first to quantify individual symptom trajectory over time, for 7 months. Three clusters of symptoms were quantified, each with different morphologies over time. The clusters of symptoms that persist longest include a combination of the neurological/cognitive and systemic symptoms. The reduced work capacity because of cognitive dysfunction, in addition to other debilitating symptoms, translated into the loss of hours, jobs, and ability to work relative to pre-illness levels.Objective To characterize the symptom profile and time course in patients with Long COVID, along with the impact on daily life, work, and return to baseline health.Design International web-based survey of suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases with illness lasting over 28 days and onset prior to June 2020.Setting Survey distribution via online COVID-19 support groups and social mediaParticipants 3,762 respondents from 56 countries completed the survey. 1166 (31.0\%) were 40-49 years old, 937 (25.0\%) were 50-59 years old, 905 (24.1\%) were 30-39 years old, 277 (7.4\%) were 18-29 years old, and 477 (12.7\%) were above 60 years old. 2961 (78.9\%) were women, 718 (19.1\%) were men, and 63 (1.7\%) were nonbinary. 317 (8.4\%) reported being hospitalized. 1020 (27.1\%) reported receiving a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19. 3608 (96\%) reported symptoms beyond 90 days.Results Prevalence of 205 symptoms in 10 organ systems was estimated in this cohort, with 66 symptoms traced over seven months. Except for loss of smell and taste, the prevalence and trajectory of all other symptoms are similar between confirmed (diagnostic/antibody positive) and suspected groups (diagnostic/antibody negative or untested). Respondents experienced symptoms in an average of 9.08 (95\% confidence interval 9.04 to 9.13) organ systems. The most frequent symptoms reported after month 6 were: fatigue (77.7\%, 74.9\% to 80.3\%), post-exertional malaise (72.2\%, 69.3\% to 75.0\%), and cognitive dysfunction (55.4\%, 52.4\% to 58.8\%). Th se three symptoms were also the three most commonly reported overall. In those who recovered in less than 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at week 2 (11.4, 9.4 to 13.6), and in those who did not recover in 90 days, the average number of symptoms peaked at month 2 (17.2, 16.5 to 17.8). Respondents with symptoms over 6 months experienced an average of 13.8 (12.7 to 14.9) symptoms in month 7. 85.9\% (84.8\% to 87.0\%) experienced relapses, with exercise, physical or mental activity, and stress as the main triggers. 86.7\% (85.6\% to 92.5\%) of unrecovered respondents were experiencing fatigue at the time of survey, compared to 44.7\% (38.5\% to 50.5\%) of recovered respondents. 45.2\% (42.9\% to 47.2\%) reported requiring a reduced work schedule compared to pre-illness and 22.3\% (20.5\% to 24.3\%) were not working at the time of survey due to their health conditions.Conclusions Patients with Long COVID report prolonged multisystem involvement and significant disability. Most had not returned to previous levels of work by 6 months.

Linear mixed models described cognitive trajectories, adjusting for factors across the life course. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} For both search speed and verbal memory, better performance at age 43 (the intercept) was associated with higher paternal and own education, childhood cognition, and adult occupational class. For search speed, the trajectory was best described as a quadratic function (decline of 45.6 letters/5-years + 4.6 letters). Verbal memory showed a linear decline of 0.20 words/5-years between ages 43 and 60 and a steeper linear decline of 0.95 words/5-years between ages 60 and 69. Decline in verbal memory in the latter period was steeper in those with higher educational achievements at age 26 (additional 0.28 words/5-years for highest attainment). \textbf{\emph{Conclusions:}} Decline in verbal memory and search speed across midlife is evident, though with different non-linear trajectories. By implication, pathways to cognitive impairment and dementia in older age may have their origins in this period.}

METHODS:: A total of 1,352 participants without dementia from the prospective Framingham Offspring Cohort Study were examined. Multivariable linear and logistic regressions were implemented to study the association of midlife vascular risk factor exposure with longitudinal change in white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), total brain volume (TBV), temporal horn volume, logical memory delayed recall, visual reproductions delayed-recall (VR-d), and Trail-Making Test B-A (TrB-A) performance a decade later. RESULTS:: Hypertension in midlife was associated with accelerated WMHV progression (p {$<$} 0.001) and worsening executive function (TrB-A score; p = 0.012). Midlife diabetes and smoking were associated with a more rapid increase in temporal horn volume, a surrogate marker of accelerated hippocampal atrophy (p = 0.017 and p = 0.008, respectively). Midlife smoking also predicted a more marked decrease in total brain volume (p = 0.025) and increased risk of extensive change in WMHV (odds ratio = 1.58 [95\%confidence interval 1.07{\textendash}2.33], p = 0.021). Obesity in midlife was associated with an increased risk of being in the top quartile of change in executive function (1.39 [1.02{\textendash}1.88], p = 0.035) and increasing waist-to-hip ratio was associated with marked decline in TBV (10.81 [1.44{\textendash}81.01], p = 0.021). Longitudinal changes in brain structure were significantly correlated with decline in memory and executive function. CONCLUSIONS:: Midlife hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and obesity were associated with an increased rate of progression of vascular brain injury, global and hippocampal atrophy, and decline in executive function a decade later.}

  abstract = {Covert vascular brain injury (VBI) is highly prevalent in community-dwelling older persons, but its clinical and therapeutic implications are debated.To better understand the clinical significance of VBI to optimize prevention strategies for the most common age-related neurological diseases, stroke and dementia.We searched for articles in PubMed between 1966 and December 22, 2017, studying the association of 4 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of covert VBI (white matter hyperintensities [WMHs] of presumed vascular origin, MRI-defined covert brain infarcts [BIs], cerebral microbleeds [CMBs], and perivascular spaces [PVSs]) with incident stroke, dementia, or death.Data were taken from prospective, longitudinal cohort studies including 50 or more adults.We performed inverse variance{\textendash}weighted meta-analyses with random effects and z score{\textendash}based meta-analyses for WMH burden. The significance threshold was P\,\&lt;\,.003 (17 independent tests). We complied with the Meta-analyses of Observational Studies in Epidemiology guidelines.Stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic), dementia (all and Alzheimer disease), and death.Of 2846 articles identified, 94 studies were eligible, with up to 14 529 participants for WMH, 16 012 participants for BI, 15 693 participants for CMB, and 4587 participants for PVS. Extensive WMH burden was associated with higher risk of incident stroke (hazard ratio [HR], 2.45; 95\% CI, 1.93-3.12; P\,\&lt;\,.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 2.39; 95\% CI, 1.65-3.47; P\,\&lt;\,.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.17; 95\% CI, 1.54-6.52; P\,=\,.002), dementia (HR, 1.84; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.43; P\,\&lt;\,.001), Alzheimer disease (HR, 1.50; 95\% CI, 1.22-1.84; P\,\&lt;\,.001), and death (HR, 2.00; 95\% CI, 1.69-2.36; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Presence of MRI-defined BIs was associated with higher risk of incident stroke (HR, 2.38; 95\% CI, 1.87-3.04; P\,\&lt;\,.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 2.18; 95\% CI, 1.67-2.85; P\,\&lt;\,.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.81; 95\% CI, 1.75-8.27; P\,\&lt;\,.001), and death (HR, 1.64; 95\% CI, 1.40-1.91; P\,\&lt;\,.001). Presence of CMBs was associated with increased risk of stroke (HR, 1.98; 95\% CI, 1.55-2.53; P\,\&lt;\,.001), ischemic stroke (HR, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.40-2.63; P\,\&lt;\,.001), intracerebral hemorrhage (HR, 3.82; 95\% CI, 2.15-6.80; P\,\&lt;\,.001), and death (HR, 1.53; 95\% CI, 1.31-1.80; P\,\&lt;\,.001).

Our aim was to examine the cross-sectional association of body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), and computed tomography (CT)-based measurements of subcutaneous (SAT) and visceral (VAT) adipose tissue with various magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) markers of brain aging in middle-aged community adults. Methods Participants from the Framingham Offspring cohort were eligible if in addition to having measurements of BMI, WC, WHR, SAT, and VAT, they had undergone a volumetric brain MRI scan with measurements of total brain volume (TCBV), temporal horn volume (THV), white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV), and MRI-defined brain infarcts (BI). All analyses were adjusted for age, sex, and time interval between abdominal CT and brain MRI. Results In a sample of 733 community participants (mean age, 60 years; 53\% women), we observed an inverse association of BMI (estimate by standard deviation unit {$\pm$} standard error = ?0.27 {$\pm$} 0.12; p = 0.02), WC (?0.30 {$\pm$} 0.12; p = 0.01), WHR (?0.37 {$\pm$} 0.12; p = 0.02), SAT (?0.23 {$\pm$} 0.11; p = 0.04), and VAT (?0.36 {$\pm$} 0.12; p = 0.002) with TCBV, independent of vascular risk factors. The association between VAT and TCBV was the strongest and most robust, and was also independent of BMI (?0.35 {$\pm$} 0.15; p = 0.02) and insulin resistance (?0.32 {$\pm$} 0.13; p = 0.01). When adjusting for C-reactive protein levels, the associations were attenuated (?0.17 {$\pm$} 0.13; p = 0.17 for VAT). No consistently significant association was observed between the anthropometric or CT-based abdominal fat measurements and THV, WMHV, or BI. Interpretation In middle-aged community participants, we observed a significant inverse association of anthropometric and CT-based measurements of abdominal, especially visceral, fat with total brain volume.

  abstract = {Abstract The prospect of declining cognitive functions is a major fear for many elderly persons. Cerebral white matter lesions, as commonly found with magnetic resonance imaging, have been associated with cognitive dysfunction in cross-sectional studies. Only a few longitudinal studies using small cohorts confirmed these findings. We examined the relation between severity of white matter lesions and cognitive decline over a nearly 10-year period in 563 elderly subjects sampled from the general nondemented Dutch population. Severity of white matter lesions was scored for periventricular and subcortical regions separately using an extensive semiquantitative scale. Cognitive function was measured by the Mini-Mental State Examination at regular time intervals during 1990 to 2000, and magnetic resonance imaging scans were made in 1995 to 1996. More severe white matter lesions were associated with more rapid cognitive decline over a mean follow-up period of 7.3 years (standard deviation, 1.5). After adjusting for age, gender, educational level, measures of depression, and brain atrophy and infarcts, subjects with severe periventricular white matter lesions experienced cognitive decline nearly three times as fast (0.28 Mini-Mental State Examination points/year [95\% confidence interval, 0.20?0.36]) as the average (0.10 points/year [95\% confidence interval, 0.09?0.11]). There was no independent relationship between severity of subcortical white matter lesions and rate of cognitive decline.}

Community-dwelling participants without dementia were examined by using a research-dedicated 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) imager on two separate visits that were, on average, 2.0 years apart. Among 810 persons who were eligible for imaging at baseline, longitudinal imaging data were available for 501 persons (mean age, 69.9 years; age range, 64.1?91.1 years). Changes in normal-appearing white matter DTI characteristics in the tract centers were analyzed globally to investigate diffuse patterns of change and then locally by using voxelwise multilinear regression. The influence of cardiovascular risk factors was assessed by treating them as additional determinants in both analyses.ResultsOver the 2.0-year follow-up interval, global fractional anisotropy (FA) decreased by 0.0042 (P {$<$} .001), while mean diffusivity (MD) increased by 8.1 ? 10?6 mm2/sec (P {$<$} .001). Voxelwise analysis of the brain white matter skeleton showed an average decrease of 0.0082 (Pmean = .002) in FA in 57\% of skeleton voxels. The sensorimotor pathway, however, showed an increase of 0.0078 (Pmean = .009) in FA. MD increased by 10.8 ? 10?6mm2/sec (Pmean {$<$} .001) on average in 79\% of white matter skeleton voxels. Additionally, white matter degeneration was more pronounced in older persons. Cardiovascular risk factors were generally not associated with longitudinal changes in white matter microstructure.ConclusionLongitudinal diffusion analysis indicates widespread microstructural deterioration of the normal-appearing white matter in normal aging, with relative sparing of sensorimotor fibers.?

Methods We followed 2,556 cognitively intact participants aged {$\geq$}60 years from the ongoing prospective community-based Swedish National Study on Aging and Care in Kungsholmen (SNAC-K). Dementia was ascertained through clinical and neuropsychological assessments and diagnosed according to Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition criteria. Structural equation modeling was used to generate a cognitive reserve indicator from 4 previously validated contributors: early life education, midlife substantive work complexity, late life leisure activities, and late life social networks. Cox proportional hazard models estimated dementia risk in relation to cognitive reserve indicator. The interaction between the cognitive reserve indicator and APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 was assessed on multiplicative and additive scales. Results After an average of 6.3 years (range = 2.1?10.7) of follow-up, 232 dementia cases were ascertained. Relative to individuals in the lowest tertile of cognitive reserve indicator, those with moderate and high reserve were at a reduced risk of dementia. There was no multiplicative interaction between APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 status and cognitive reserve indicator (p = 0.113). Additive interaction was statistically significant. Relative to APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 carriers with low cognitive reserve, {$\epsilon$}4 carriers with high reserve had a reduced risk of dementia (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.28, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 0.13?0.59). The magnitude of risk reduction was similar in {$\epsilon$}4 noncarriers with a high cognitive reserve indicator (HR = 0.24, 95\% CI = 0.15?0.40). Interpretation Lifelong engagement in reserve-enhancing activities attenuates the risk of dementia attributable to APOE-{$\epsilon$}4. Promoting cognitive reserve might be especially effective in subpopulations with high genetic risk of dementia. ANN NEUROL 2019}

  abstract = {A significantly increased interest has been dedicated to the study of the effects of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the brain. DM is associated with an increased risk of stroke and cognitive decline. In patients with DM, neuroimaging discloses with high-frequency structural changes, such as cerebral atrophy, infarcts and white matter lesions, also called leukoaraiosis (LA), an expression of small vessel disease. A previous review showed a relation between DM and both cerebral atrophy and lacunar infarcts, while the question about the relation between DM and LA remained unanswered. In this review, we provide an update on data on this last association. In the reviewed studies, we examined the presence of DM, other disease characteristics, such as duration and complications, and laboratory markers of the disease such as blood glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), insulin resistance, insulin concentrations and their association with LA. About 40\% of the reviewed studies reported a statistically significant association between DM and LA. Long-standing DM and a poor glycemic control were associated with severe LA. Studies using innovative MRI techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), reported a significant association between microstructural white matter alterations and DM. This review highlights more firmly than previously reported the existence of a relation between DM and both presence and severity of LA. These results are possibly due to more sensitive and advanced imaging techniques recently used to study the extent of LA. However, because of the heterogeneous methodology used in the reviewed studies, a definitive conclusion cannot be drawn.},

We compared the distribution of the acute infarcts with that of white matter hyperintensity and lacunes using computational image mapping methods.ResultsIn 188 patients, mean age 67 {$\pm$} standard deviation 12 years, the lesions that presented with acute lacunar ischaemic stroke were located in or near the main motor and sensory tracts in (descending order): posterior limb of the internal capsule (probability density 0{$\cdot$}2/mm3), centrum semiovale (probability density = 0{$\cdot$}15/mm3), medial lentiform nucleus/lateral thalamus (probability density = 0{$\cdot$}09/mm3), and pons (probability density = 0{$\cdot$}02/mm3). Most lacunes were in the lentiform nucleus (probability density = 0{$\cdot$}01?0{$\cdot$}04/mm3) or external capsule (probability density = 0{$\cdot$}05/mm3). Most white matter hyperintensities were in centrum semiovale (except for the area affected by the acute symptomatic infarcts), external capsules, basal ganglia, and brainstem, with little overlap with the acute symptomatic infarcts (analysis of variance, P {$<$} 0{$\cdot$}01).ConclusionsLesions that present with acute lacunar ischaemic stroke symptoms may be more likely noticed by the patient through affecting the main motor and sensory tracts, whereas white matter hyperintensity and asymptomatic lacunes mainly affect other areas. Brain location could at least partly explain the symptomatic vs. covert development of small vessel disease.}

  abstract = {White matter lesions are frequently found on cerebral MRI scans of elderly people and are thought to be important in the pathogenesis of dementia. Hyper tension has been associated with the presence of white matter lesions but this has been investigated almost exclusively in cross-sectional studies. We studied prospectively the association of these lesions with the duration and treatment of hypertension. We randomly sampled 1077 subjects aged between 60 and 90~years from two prospective population-based studies. One-half of the study subjects had their blood pressure measured between 1975 and 1978 and the other half between 1990 and 1993. All subjects underwent 1.5~T MRI scanning; white matter lesions in the subcortical and periventricular regions were rated separately. Subjects with hypertension had increased rates of both types of white matter lesion. Duration of hypertension was associated with both periventricular and subcortical white matter lesions. This relationship was influenced strongly by age. For participants with \&gt;20~years of hypertension and aged between 60 and 70~years at the time of follow-up, the relative risks for subcortical and periventricular white matter lesions were 24.3 [95\% confidence interval (CI) 5.1{\textendash}114.8] and 15.8 (95\% CI 3.4{\textendash}73.5), respectively, compared with normotensive subjects. Subjects with successfully treated hypertension had only moderately increased rates of subcortical white matter lesions and periventricular white matter lesions (relative risk 3.3, 95\% CI 1.3{\textendash}8.4 and 2.6, 95\% CI 1.0{\textendash}6.8, respectively) compared with normotensive subjects. For poorly controlled hypertensives, these relative risks were 8.4 (95\% CI 3.1{\textendash}22.6) and 5.8 (95\% CI 2.1{\textendash}16.0), respectively. In conclusion, we found a relationship between long-standing hypertension and the presence of white matter lesions. Our findings are consistent with the view that effective treatment may reduce the rates of both types of white matter lesion. Adequate treatment of hypertension may therefore prevent white matter lesions and the associated cognitive decline.}

Understanding whether nutritional biomarker levels are associated with clinical progression could help to design dietary intervention trials. This longitudinal study examined a panel of nutritional biomarkers in relation to clinical progression in patients with subjective cognitive decline (SCD) or mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Design, setting and participants We included 299 patients without dementia (n~= 149 SCD; age 61 {$\pm$} 10~years, female 44\%, n~= 150 MCI; age 66 {$\pm$} 8~years, female 38\%). Median (interquartile range) follow-up was 3 (2-5) years. Methods We measured 28 nutritional biomarkers in blood and 5 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), associated with 3 Alzheimer's disease pathologic processes: vascular change (lipids), synaptic dysfunction (homocysteine-related metabolites), and oxidative stress (minerals and vitamins). Nutritional biomarker associations with clinical progression to MCI/dementia and cognitive decline based on the Mini-Mental State Examination score were evaluated using Cox proportional hazard models and linear mixed models. We used partial least squares Cox models (PLS-Cox) to examine nutritional biomarker profiles associated with clinical progression. Results In the total group, high high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels were associated with clinical progression and cognitive decline. In SCD, high folate and low bilirubin levels were associated with cognitive decline. In MCI, low CSF S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and high theobromine were associated with clinical progression to dementia and high HDL, cholesterol, iron, and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D were associated with cognitive decline. PLS-Cox showed 1 profile for SCD, characterized by high betaine and folate and low zinc associated with clinical progression. In MCI, a profile with high theobromine and HDL and low triglycerides and a second profile with high plasma SAM and low cholesterol were associated with risk of dementia. Conclusion and Implications High HDL was most consistently associated with clinical progression. Moreover, different nutritional biomarker profiles for SCD and MCI showed promising associations with clinical progression. Future dietary (intervention) studies could use nutritional biomarker profiles to select patients, taking into account the disease stage.},

  abstract = {Background WMH in the corpus callosum (CC), as previously related to AD pathology(1) and lower cognition in AD patients(2), are suggested to play an important role in AD. The Aim of this study was to substantiate the associations between WMH location, biomarkers of AD pathophysiology, and cognitive performance in the DELCODE study. Method 429 participants were included (HC: 126, SCD: 165, MCI: 87, AD: 51). WMH volumes were segmented from FLAIR images. WMH volumes were adjusted for total intracranial volume and log-transformed. Beta-Amyloid and total Tau (A{\ss}42 and tTau, measured in CSF) and neurodegeneration (ND, measured by hippocampal volume) were log-transformed and used as surrogate markers for AD pathophysiology. Cognitive performance was assessed by a global cognitive composite. Path modelling, adjusted for age, sex and education, was performed to estimate direct and indirect associations between regional WMH volumes (in the CC splenium, body, genu and the frontal lobe as possible control region), AD biomarkers and cognition. Results The correlation matrix (Figure 1) showed the highest correlation of A{\ss}42 and tTau with WMH volume the splenium CC. Greater WMH volume in the splenium CC was directly associated with lower global cognition (Figure 2a, {\ss} = -0.10, p = 0.01) and indirectly through A{\ss}42 ({\ss} = -0.10, p = 0.001) and ND (Figure 2b, {\ss} = -0.05, p = 0.001). The same indirect association was statistically significant regarding tTau ({\ss} = -0.03, p {$<$} 0.001). Model outcomes were similar for the body and genu of the CC. For frontal WMH volume, the direct association with global cognition was not statistically significant ({\ss} = -0.002, p = 0.96), only through indirect associations with A{\ss}42 ({\ss} = -0.05, p = 0.003) and ND ({\ss} = -0.02, p = 0.05). Conclusion WMH in the CC are associated with lower cognitive performance through direct and indirect associations with A{\ss}42 and neurodegeneration. Similar associations were seen for frontal WMH. However, a direct association between frontal WMH volume and cognition was not noticed, when considering AD biomarkers. Our study substantiates the clinical relevance and impact of WMH in the CC, in particular the splenium, in AD. 1)Gaubert et al.,2021 2)Garnier-Crussard et al.,2021},

  abstract = {Normal aging and Alzheimer's disease cause profound changes in the brain's structure and function. AD in particular is accompanied by widespread cortical neuronal loss, and loss of connections between brain systems. This degeneration of neural pathways disrupts the functional coherence of brain activation. Recent innovations in brain imaging have detected characteristic disruptions in functional networks. Here we review studies examining changes in functional connectivity, measured through fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging), starting with healthy aging and then Alzheimer's disease (AD). We cover studies that employ the three primary methods to analyze functional connectivity {\textendash} seed-based, ICA (independent components analysis), and graph theory. At the end we include a brief discussion of other methodologies, such as EEG (electroencephalography), MEG (magnetoencephalography), and PET (positron emission tomography). We also describe multi-modal studies that combine rsfMRI (resting state fMRI) with PET imaging, as well as studies examining the effects of medications. Overall, connectivity and network integrity appear to decrease in healthy aging, but this decrease is accelerated in AD, with specific systems hit hardest, such as the default mode network (DMN). Functional connectivity is a relatively new topic of research, but it holds great promise in revealing how brain network dynamics change across the lifespan and in disease.}

  abstract = {The dysregulation of food intake in chronic obesity has been explained by different theories. To assess their explanatory power, we meta-analyzed 22 brain-activation imaging studies. We found that obese individuals exhibit hyper-responsivity of the brain regions involved in taste and reward for food-related stimuli. Consistent with a Reward Surfeit Hypothesis, obese individuals exhibit a ventral striatum hyper-responsivity in response to pure tastes, particularly when fasting. Furthermore, we found that obese subjects display more frequent ventral striatal activation for visual food cues when satiated: this continued processing within the reward system, together with the aforementioned evidence, is compatible with the Incentive Sensitization Theory. On the other hand, we did not find univocal evidence in favor of a Reward Deficit Hypothesis nor for a systematic deficit of inhibitory cognitive control. We conclude that the available brain activation data on the dysregulated food intake and food-related behavior in chronic obesity can be best framed within an Incentive Sensitization Theory. Implications of these findings for a brain-based therapy of obesity are briefly discussed.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a flexible medical imaging modality that often lacks reproducibility between protocols and scanners. It has been shown that even when care is taken to standardize acquisitions, any changes in hardware, software, or protocol design can lead to differences in quantitative results. This greatly impacts the quantitative utility of MRI in multi-site or long-term studies, where consistency is often valued over image quality. We propose a method of contrast harmonization, called DeepHarmony, which uses a U-Net-based deep learning architecture to produce images with consistent contrast. To provide training data, a small overlap cohort (n\,=\,8) was scanned using two different protocols. Images harmonized with DeepHarmony showed significant improvement in consistency of volume quantification between scanning protocols. A longitudinal MRI dataset of patients with multiple sclerosis was also used to evaluate the effect of a protocol change on atrophy calculations in a clinical research setting. The results show that atrophy calculations were substantially and significantly affected by protocol change, whereas such changes have a less significant effect and substantially reduced overall difference when using DeepHarmony. This establishes that DeepHarmony can be used with an overlap cohort to reduce inconsistencies in segmentation caused by changes in scanner protocol, allowing for modernization of hardware and protocol design in long-term studies without invalidating previously acquired data.},

  abstract = {Dementia is a global problem and major target for health care providers. Although up to 45\% of cases are primarily or partly due to cerebrovascular disease, little is known of these mechanisms or treatments because most dementia research still focuses on pure Alzheimer's disease. An improved understanding of the vascular contributions to neurodegeneration and dementia, particularly by small vessel disease, is hampered by imprecise data, including the incidence and prevalence of symptomatic and clinically ``silent'' cerebrovascular disease, long-term outcomes (cognitive, stroke, or functional), and risk factors. New large collaborative studies with long follow-up are expensive and time consuming, yet substantial data to advance the field are available. In an initiative funded by the Joint Programme for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, 55 international experts surveyed and assessed available data, starting with European cohorts, to promote data sharing to advance understanding of how vascular disease affects brain structure and function, optimize methods for cerebrovascular disease in neurodegeneration research, and focus future research on gaps in knowledge. Here, we summarize the results and recommendations from this initiative. We identified data from over 90 studies, including over 660,000 participants, many being additional to neurodegeneration data initiatives. The enthusiastic response means that cohorts from North America, Australasia, and the Asia Pacific Region are included, creating a truly global, collaborative, data sharing platform, linked to major national dementia initiatives. Furthermore, the revised World Health Organization International Classification of Diseases version 11 should facilitate recognition of vascular-related brain damage by creating one category for all cerebrovascular disease presentations and thus accelerate identification of targets for dementia prevention.},

Methods: We selected 1,168 subjects from the population-based Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam who were 62 to 85 years of age and had no obvious cognitive impairment at baseline (Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score, {$\geq$}27). Memory complaints and APOE phenotypes were assessed at baseline. MMSE, the Auditory Verbal Learning Test (memory: immediate recall and delayed recall), and the Alphabet Coding Task{\textendash}15 (information processing speed) were used to study cognitive decline. Follow-up data were collected after 3 and 6 years. Data were analyzed with generalized estimating equations, adjusted for age, sex, education, and depression. Results: Baseline memory complaints were reported by 25.5\% of the cognitively intact elderly persons. Overall, 25.3\% of the subjects were carriers of at least one APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 allele. Memory complaints were associated with a greater rate of decline in all cognitive measures, except immediate recall. In addition, APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 allele carriers had a greater rate of cognitive decline shown by MMSE scores and slower information processing speeds after 6 years. The effects of both memory complaints and APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 allele carriage were additive: subjects with both factors had a two times higher cognitive decline than did subjects without both factors. Conclusions: Both memory complaints and APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 allele carriage predict cognitive decline at an early stage. This finding highlights the importance of subjective memory complaints, which are important even at an early stage when objective tests are still unable to detect cognitive deficits and are especially important for elderly carriers of the APOE-{$\epsilon$}4 allele because they have an additional risk.}

Overconsumption of food high in fat not only promotes weight gain but elicits changes in reward processing. No studies to date have examined whether consumption of a high-fat (HF) diet alters structural plasticity in brain areas critical for reward processing, which may account for persistent changes in behavior and psychological function by reorganizing synaptic connectivity. To test whether dietary fat may induce structural plasticity we placed rats on one of three dietary conditions: ad libitum standard chow (SC), ad libitum 60~\% HF (HF-AL), or calorically matched 60~\% HF (HF-CM) for 3~weeks and then quantified dendritic spine density and type on basal and apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer V of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) of the nucleus accumbens. Our results demonstrate a significant reduction in the density of thin spines on the apical and basal segments of dendrites within the infralimbic, but not prelimbic, mPFC.}

However, the existing literature leads to debate for different issues, such as the measurement of the adherence to the Mediterranean diet, the use of a wide variety of dietary indices with various food components and the large heterogeneity across the studies. In order to summarise the evidence and evaluate the validity of the association between the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and multiple health outcomes, an umbrella review of the evidence across meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised clinical trials (RCTs) was performed. Thirteen meta-analyses of observational studies and 16 meta-analyses of RCTs investigating the association between the adherence to the Mediterranean diet and 37 different health outcomes, for a total population of over than 12\,800\,000 subjects, were identified. A robust evidence, supported by a P-value{$<$}0.001, a large simple size, and not a considerable heterogeneity between studies, for a greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet and a reduced the risk of overall mortality, cardiovascular diseases, coronary heart disease, myocardial infarction, overall cancer incidence, neurodegenerative diseases and diabetes was found. For most of the site-specific cancers, as well as for inflammatory and metabolic parameters, the evidence was only suggestive or weak and further studies are needed to draw firmer conclusions. No evidence, on the other hand, was reported for bladder, endometrial and ovarian cancers, as well as for LDL (low density lipoprotein)-cholesterol levels.}

  abstract = {See Coulthard and Knight (doi:10.1093/aww335) for a scientific commentary on this article.Individuals with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease clinical diagnoses can display significant phenotypic heterogeneity. This variability likely reflects underlying genetic, environmental and neuropathological differences. Characterizing this heterogeneity is important for precision diagnostics, personalized predictions, and recruitment of relatively homogeneous sets of patients into clinical trials. In this study, we apply state-of-the-art semi-supervised machine learning methods to the Alzheimer's disease Neuroimaging cohort (ADNI) to elucidate the heterogeneity of neuroanatomical differences between subjects with mild cognitive impairment (n = 530) and Alzheimer's disease (n = 314) and cognitively normal individuals (n = 399), thereby adding to an increasing literature aiming to establish neuroanatomical and neuropathological (e.g. amyloid and tau deposition) dimensions in Alzheimer's disease and its prodromal stages. These dimensional approaches aim to provide surrogate measures of heterogeneous underlying pathologic processes leading to cognitive impairment. We relate these neuroimaging patterns to cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers, white matter hyperintensities, cognitive and clinical measures, and longitudinal trajectories. We identified four such atrophy patterns: (i) individuals with largely normal neuroanatomical profiles, who also turned out to have the least abnormal cognitive and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker profiles and the slowest clinical progression during follow-up; (ii) individuals with classical Alzheimer's disease neuroanatomical, cognitive, cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and clinical profile, who presented the fastest clinical progression; (iii) individuals with a diffuse pattern of atrophy with relatively less pronounced involvement of the medial temporal lobe, abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-{$\beta$}1-42 values, and proportionally greater executive impairment; and (iv) individuals with notably focal involvement of the medial temporal lobe and a slow steady progression, likely representing in early Alzheimer's disease stages. These four atrophy patterns effectively define a 4-dimensional categorization of neuroanatomical alterations in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease that can complement existing dimensional approaches for staging Alzheimer's disease using a variety of biomarkers, which offer the potential for enabling precision diagnostics and prognostics, as well as targeted patient recruitment of relatively homogeneous subgroups of subjects for clinical trials.}

It is unknown to what extent these associations reflect genetic confounding and whether the obesity-related connectivity changes are associated with differences in dietary intake. In this study, resting state functional MRI was performed after an overnight fast in 16 female monozygotic twin pairs (aged 48.8 +/- 9.8 years) with a mean BMI discordance of 3.96 +/- 2.1 kg/m2 (range 0.7-8.2). Functional connectivity of the salience, basal ganglia, default mode and anterior cingulate-orbitofrontal cortex networks was examined by independent component analysis. Dietary intake was assessed using 3-day 24-hour recalls. Results revealed that within the basal ganglia network, heavier versus leaner co-twins have decreased functional connectivity strength in bilateral putamen (P {$<$} 0.05, FWE-corrected). There were no differences in connectivity in the other networks examined. In the overall group, lower functional connectivity strength in the left putamen was correlated with higher intake of total fat (P {$<$} 0.01). It was concluded that, after eliminating genetic effects, overweight is associated with lower resting state functional connectivity in bilateral putamen in the basal ganglia network. The association between lower putamen connectivity and higher fat intake suggests an important role of the putamen in appetitive mechanisms. The cross-sectional nature of our study cannot discriminate cause and consequence, but the findings are compatible with an effect of lower putamen connectivity on increased BMI and associated higher fat intake.

The availability of pre-infection imaging data reduces the likelihood of pre-existing risk factors being misinterpreted as disease effects. We identified significant longitudinal effects when comparing the two groups, including (1) a greater reduction in grey matter thickness and tissue contrast in the orbitofrontal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus; (2) greater changes in markers of tissue damage in regions that are functionally connected to the primary olfactory cortex; and (3) a greater reduction in global brain size~in the SARS-CoV-2 cases. The participants who were infected with SARS-CoV-2 also showed on average a greater cognitive decline between the two time points. Importantly, these imaging and cognitive longitudinal effects were still observed after excluding the 15 patients who had been hospitalised. These mainly limbic brain imaging results may be the in vivo hallmarks of a degenerative spread of the disease through olfactory pathways, of neuroinflammatory events, or of the loss of sensory input due to anosmia. Whether this deleterious effect can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up.},

  abstract = {There is strong evidence for brain-related pathologies in COVID-19, some of which could be a consequence of viral neurotropism. The vast majority of brain imaging studies so far have focused on qualitative, gross pathology of moderate to severe cases, often carried out on hospitalised patients. It remains unknown however whether the impact of COVID-19 can be detected in milder cases, in a quantitative and automated manner, and whether this can reveal a possible mechanism for the spread of the disease. UK Biobank scanned over 40,000 participants before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, making it possible to invite back in 2021 hundreds of previously-imaged participants for a second imaging visit. Here, we studied the effects of the disease in the brain using multimodal data from 782 participants from the UK Biobank COVID-19 re-imaging study, with 394 participants having tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection between their two scans. We used structural and functional brain scans from before and after infection, to compare longitudinal brain changes between these 394 COVID-19 patients and 388 controls who were matched for age, sex, ethnicity and interval between scans. We identified significant effects of COVID-19 in the brain with a loss of grey matter in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left lateral orbitofrontal cortex and the left insula. When looking over the entire cortical surface, these results extended to the anterior cingulate cortex, supramarginal gyrus and temporal pole. We further compared COVID-19 patients who had been hospitalised (n=15) with those who had not (n=379), and while results were not significant, we found comparatively similar findings to the COVID-19 vs control group comparison, with, in addition, a greater loss of grey matter in the cingulate cortex, central nucleus of the amygdala and hippocampal cornu ammonis (all {\textbar}Z{\textbar}\&amp;gt;3). Our findings thus consistently relate to loss of grey matter in limbic cortical areas directly linked to the primary olfactory and gustatory system. Unlike in post hoc disease studies, the availability of pre-infection imaging data helps avoid the danger of pre-existing risk factors or clinical conditions being mis-interpreted as disease effects. Since a possible entry point of the virus to the central nervous system might be via the olfactory mucosa and the olfactory bulb, these brain imaging results might be the in vivo hallmark of the spread of the disease (or the virus itself) via olfactory and gustatory pathways.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.Funding StatementThis work was primarily supported by a Wellcome Trust Collaborative Award 215573/Z/19/Z.

The present observational study assessed effects of an 8-week weight loss period ({$\geq$}8\% of body weight), and a subsequent 22-month weight maintenance period on grey matter volume and cortical thickness. Methods A total of 24 participants (12f/12\,m; age 52.8\,{$\pm$}\,10.6\,years) with overweight/obesity and pre-diabetes were recruited. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging was used to determine grey matter volume and cortical thickness at baseline, after the weight loss period and after a medium to high dietary protein weight maintenance period. Results At baseline, global grey matter volume was inversely associated with HOMA-IR, adjusted for sex and age (r\,=\,-0.42; p\,=\,.049). During the weight loss period participants decreased their BMI (32.1\,{$\pm$}\,3.3 to 28.1\,{$\pm$}\,2.8\,kg/m2, p\,{$<$}\,.01), body-fat (41.6\,{$\pm$}\,6.4 to 35.0\,{$\pm$}\,8.0\%, p\,{$<$}\,.01) and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR: 4.0\,{$\pm$}\,2.0 to 1.8\,{$\pm$}\,0.9, p\,{$<$}\,.01). During the 22-month weight maintenance period, these parameters gradually increased again (BMI: 29.3\,{$\pm$}\,3.8\,kg/m2; body-fat: 37.8\,{$\pm$}\,9.3\%; HOMA-IR: 2.9\,{$\pm$}\,1.4, p\,{$<$}\,.01). Global grey matter volume and cortical thickness did not change significantly during the weight loss or weight maintenance period. Changes in body weight, body-fat percentage or insulin sensitivity were not associated with changes in global grey matter volume. Conclusion In conclusion, we confirmed that global grey brain matter volume was inversely associated with insulin resistance at baseline, yet an intervention yielding a decrease in insulin resistance did not lead to changes in global grey brain matter volume or cortical thickness.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To supply the attending doctor's diagnosis of the persisting of cerebral small vessel disease and speed up their work effectively, we developed a "deep learning system (DLS)" for cerebral small vessel disease predication. The reliability and the disease area segmentation accuracy, of the proposed DLS, was also investigated. METHODS: A deep learning model based on the convolutional neural network was designed and trained on 1,010 DWI b1000 images from 1010 patients diagnosed with segmentation of subcortical infarction, 359 T2({$\ast$}) images from 359 patients diagnosed with segmentation of cerebral microbleed, as well as 824 T1-weighted and T2-FLAIR images from 824 patients diagnosed with segmentation of lacune and WMH. Dicw accuracy, recall, and f1-score were calculated to evaluate the proposed deep learning model. Finally, we also compared the DLS prediction capability with that of 6 doctors with 3 to 18 years' clinical experience (8 {$\pm$} 6 years). RESULTS: The results support that an appropriately trained DLS can achieve a high-level dice accuracy, 0.598 in the training section over all these four classifications on 30 patients (0.576 for young neuroradiologists), validation accuracy is 0.496 in lacune, 0.666 in WMH, 0.728 in subcortical infarction, and 0.503 in cerebral microbleeds. It is comparable to attending doctor with a few years of experience, regardless of whether the emphasis is placed on the segmentation or detection of lesions with less time-spending compared with manual analysis, about 4.4 s/case, which is dramatically less than doctors about 634 s/case. CONCLUSION: The results of our comparison lend support to the case that an appropriately trained DLS can be trusted to the same extent as one would trust an attending doctor with a few years of experience, regardless of whether the emphasis is placed on the segmentation or detection of lesions.},

However, the origin of diffusion alterations in SVD is largely unknown. METHODS: To gain further insight, we applied free water (FW) imaging to patients with genetically defined SVD (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy [CADASIL], n~=~57), sporadic SVD (n~=~444), and healthy controls (n~=~28). We modeled freely diffusing water in the extracellular space (FW) and measures reflecting fiber structure (tissue compartment). We tested associations between these measures and clinical status (processing speed and disability). RESULTS: Diffusion alterations in SVD were mostly driven by increased FW and less by tissue compartment alterations. Among imaging markers, FW showed the strongest association with clinical status (R2 up to 34\%, P~{$<~$}.0001). Findings were consistent across patients with CADASIL and sporadic SVD. DISCUSSION: Diffusion alterations and clinical status in SVD are largely determined by extracellular fluid increase rather than alterations of white matter fiber organization.},

As cardiovascular risk profiles vary greatly by gender, with men suffering a greater burden of cardiovascular risk in midlife, this could lead to differences in dementia risk. To explore current evidence on the association between components of the cardiovascular risk profile and dementia risk in women and men, we reviewed all studies reporting the risk of dementia associated with cardiovascular risk factors stratified by gender and found 53 eligible articles out of over 4,000 published since the year 2000. Consistent results were found: 1) for exposures acting specifically in women: Overweight/obesity (harmful) and physical activity (protective), and 2) for exposures acting similarly in women and men: Moderate alcohol (protective) and hypertension, diabetes, and depression (harmful). A modified effect of tobacco or high cholesterol/statin use remained controversial. Available data do not allow us to assess whether selection of men with healthier cardiovascular profile (due to cardiovascular death in midlife) could lead in late life either to a difference in the distribution of risk factors or to a differential effect of these risk factors by gender. We recommend that results on dementia risk factors, especially cardiovascular ones, be reported systematically by gender in all future studies. More generally, as cardiovascular risk profiles evolve over time, more attention needs to be paid to the detection and correction of cardiovascular risk factors, as early as possible in the life course, and as actively in women as in men.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the major public health impact of diabetes, recent population-based data regarding its prevalence and comorbidity are sparse. METHODS: The prevalence and comorbidity of diabetes mellitus were analyzed in a nationally representative sample (N = 9133) of the non-institutionalized German adult population aged 50 years and older. Information on physician-diagnosed diabetes and 20 other chronic health conditions was collected as part of the national telephone health interview survey `German Health Update (GEDA)' 2009. Overall, 51.2\% of contacted persons participated. Among persons with diabetes, diabetes severity was defined according to the type and number of diabetes-concordant conditions: no diabetes-concordant condition (grade 1); hypertension and/or hyperlipidemia only (grade 2); one comorbidity likely to represent diabetes-related micro- or macrovascular end-organ damage (grade 3); several such comorbidities (grade 4). Determinants of diabetes severity were analyzed by multivariable ordinal regression. RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of diabetes was 13.6\% with no significant difference between men and women. Persons with diabetes had a significantly higher prevalence and average number of diabetes-concordant as well as diabetes-discordant comorbidities than persons without diabetes. Among persons with diabetes, 10.2\%, 46.8\%, 35.6\% and 7.4\% were classified as having severity grade 1{\textendash}4, respectively. Determinants of diabetes severity included age (cumulative odds ratio 1.05, 95\% confidence interval 1.03-1.07, per year) and number of discordant comorbidities (1.40, 1.25-1.55). With respect to specific discordant comorbidities, diabetes severity was correlated to depression (2.15, 1.29-3.56), respiratory disease (2.75, 1.72-4.41), musculoskeletal disease (1.53, 1.06-2.21), and severe hearing impairment (3.00, 1.21-7.41). CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes is highly prevalent in the non-institutionalized German adult population 50 years and older. Diabetes comorbidities including diabetes-concordant and diabetes-discordant conditions need to be considered in epidemiological studies, in order to monitor disease burden and quality of diabetes care. Definitional standards of diabetes severity need to be refined and consented.}

  abstract = {Objectives In this cross-sectional study, we aimed to explore the mechanisms of early cognitive impairment in a post stroke non-dementia cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) cohort by comparing the SVD score with the structural brain network measures. Method 127 SVD patients were recruited consecutively from a stroke clinic, comprising 76 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 51 with no cognitive impairment (NCI). Detailed neuropsychological assessments and multimodal MRI were performed. SVD scores were calculated on a standard scale, and structural brain network measures were analyzed by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Between-group differences were analyzed, and logistic regression was applied to determine the predictive value of SVD and network measures for cognitive status. Mediation analysis with structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to better understand the interactions of SVD burden, brain networks and cognitive deficits. Results Group difference was found on all global brain network measures. After adjustment for age, gender, education and depression, significant correlations were found between global brain network measures and diverse neuropsychological tests, including TMT-B (r\,=\,-0.209, p\,{$<$}\,.05), DSST (r\,=\,0.206, p\,{$<$}\,.05), AVLT short term free recall (r\,=\,0.233, p\,{$<$}\,.05), AVLT long term free recall (r\,=\,0.264, p\,{$<$}\,.05) and Rey-O copy (r\,=\,0.272, p\,{$<$}\,.05). SVD score showed no group difference and was not correlated with cognition tests. Network global efficiency (EGlobal) was significantly related to cognitive state (p\,{$<$}\,.01) but not the SVD score. Mediation analysis showed that the standardized total effect (p\,=\,.013) and the standardized indirect effect (p\,=\,.016) of SVD score on cognition was significant, but the direct effect was not. Conclusions Brain network measures, but not the SVD score, are significantly correlated with cognition in post-stroke SVD patients. Mediation analysis showed that the cerebral vascular lesions produce cognitive dysfunction by interfering with the structural brain network in SVD patients. The brain network measures may be regarded as direct and independent surrogate markers of cognitive impairment in SVD.},

  abstract = {The neocortex of the human brain is the seat of higher brain function. Modern imaging techniques, chief among them magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), allow non-invasive imaging of this important structure. Knowledge of the microstructure of the neocortex has classically come from post-mortem histological studies of human tissue, and extrapolations from invasive animal studies. From these studies, we know that the scale of important neocortical structure spans six orders of magnitude, ranging from the size of axonal diameters (microns), to the size of cortical areas responsible for integrating sensory information (centimetres). MRI presents an opportunity to move beyond classical methods, because MRI is non-invasive and MRI contrast is sensitive to neocortical microstructure over all these length scales. MRI thus allows inferences to be made about neocortical microstructure in vivo, i.e. MRI-based in vivo histology. We review recent literature that has applied and developed MRI-based in vivo histology to probe the microstructure of the human neocortex, focusing specifically on myelin, iron, and neuronal fibre mapping. We find that applications such as cortical parcellation (using R1 maps as proxies for myelin content) and investigation of cortical iron deposition with age (using R2* maps) are already contributing to the frontiers of knowledge in neuroscience. Neuronal fibre mapping in the cortex remains challenging in vivo, but recent improvements in diffusion MRI hold promise for exciting applications in the near future. The literature also suggests that utilising multiple complementary quantitative MRI maps could increase the specificity of inferences about neocortical microstructure relative to contemporary techniques, but that further investment in modelling is required to appropriately combine the maps. In vivo histology of human neocortical microstructure is undergoing rapid development. Future developments will improve its specificity, sensitivity, and clinical applicability, granting an ever greater ability to investigate neuroscientific and clinical questions about the human neocortex.},

  abstract = {Objectives: To determine the rate of brain atrophy in neurologically asymptomatic elderly and to investigate the impact of baseline variables including conventional cerebrovascular risk factors, APOE {$\epsilon$}4, and white matter hyperintensity (WMH) on its progression.Methods: We assessed the brain parenchymal fraction at baseline and subsequent annual brain volume changes over 6 years for 201 participants (F/M = 96/105; 59.8 {$\pm$} 5.9 years) in the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study from 1.5-T MRI scans using SIENA (structural image evaluation using normalization of atrophy)/SIENAX (an adaptation of SIENA for cross-sectional measurement)(www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Hypertension, cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, smoking, and regular alcohol intake were present in 64 (31.8\%), 60 (29.9\%), 5 (2.5\%), 70 (39.3\%), and 40 (20.7\%) subjects, respectively. Plasma levels of fasting glucose (93.7 {$\pm$} 18.6 mg/dL), glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c; 5.6 {$\pm$} 0.7\%), total cholesterol (228.3 {$\pm$} 40.3 mg/dL), and triglycerides (127.0 {$\pm$} 75.2 mg/dL) were determined. WMH was rated as absent (n = 56), punctate (n = 120), early confluent (n = 14), and confluent (n = 11).Results: The baseline brain parenchymal fraction of the entire cohort was 0.80 {$\pm$} 0.02 with a mean annual brain volume change of -0.40 {$\pm$} 0.29\%. Univariate analysis demonstrated a higher rate of brain atrophy in older subjects (p = 0.0001), in those with higher HbA1c (p = 0.0001), higher body mass index (p = 0.02), high alcohol intake (p = 0.04), severe WMH (p = 0.03), and in APOE {$\epsilon$}4 carriers (p = 0.07). Multivariate analysis suggested that baseline brain parenchymal fraction, HbA1c, and WMH score explain a major proportion of variance in the rates of brain atrophy in the cohort (corrected R2 = 0.27; p = 0.0001).Conclusions: Neurologically asymptomatic elderly experience continuing brain volume loss, which appears to accelerate with age. Glycated hemoglobin A (HbA1c) was identified as a risk factor for a greater rate of brain atrophy. Clustering of factors associated with the so-called metabolic syndrome in subjects with high HbA1c suggests a link between this syndrome and late-life brain tissue loss.}

  abstract = {Spatial independent component analysis (ICA) applied to functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data identifies functionally connected networks by estimating spatially independent patterns from their linearly mixed fMRI signals. Several multi-subject ICA approaches estimating subject-specific time courses (TCs) and spatial maps (SMs) have been developed, however, there has not yet been a full comparison of the implications of their use. Here, we provide extensive comparisons of four multi-subject ICA approaches in combination with data reduction methods for simulated and fMRI task data. For multi-subject ICA, the data first undergo reduction at the subject and group levels using principal component analysis (PCA). Comparisons of subject-specific, spatial concatenation, and group data mean subject-level reduction strategies using PCA and probabilistic PCA (PPCA) show that computationally intensive PPCA is equivalent to PCA, and that subject-specific and group data mean subject-level PCA are preferred because of well-estimated TCs and SMs. Second, aggregate independent components are estimated using either noise-free ICA or probabilistic ICA (PICA). Third, subject-specific SMs and TCs are estimated using back-reconstruction. We compare several direct group ICA (GICA) back-reconstruction approaches (GICA1-GICA3) and an indirect back-reconstruction approach, spatio-temporal regression (STR, or dual regression). Results show the earlier group ICA (GICA1) approximates STR, however STR has contradictory assumptions and may show mixed-component artifacts in estimated SMs. Our evidence-based recommendation is to use GICA3, introduced here, with subject-specific PCA and noise-free ICA, providing the most robust and accurate estimated SMs and TCs in addition to offering an intuitive interpretation.},

The BBB both affects and is affected by the immune system and connects at many levels with the CNS, including the following: (1) the BBB transports cytokines and secretes various substances with neuroinflammatory properties; (2) transporters are altered in disease states including traumatic injury, Alzheimer's disease and inflammatory processes; (3) cytokines and other immune secretions from the cells comprising the BBB are both constitutive and inducible; (4) immune cells are transported across the BBB by the highly regulated process termed diapedesis, which involves communication and interactions between the brain endothelial cells and the immune cells; (5) the neuroimmune system has various effects on the BBB, including modulation of important transport systems and in extreme pathological conditions even disruption of the BBB, and (6) the brain-to-blood efflux transporter P-glycoprotein is altered in inflammatory conditions, thus affecting drug delivery to the brain. In summary, the BBB is an interactive interface that regulates and defines many of the ways that the CNS and the immune system communicate with one another.}

The epidemiological literature provides compelling evidence that greater amounts of physical activity are associated with a reduced risk of dementia in late life. In addition, randomized interventions using neuroimaging tools have reported that participation in physical activity increases the size of prefrontal and hippocampal brain areas, which may lead to a reduction in memory impairments. Consistent with these findings, longitudinal studies using neuroimaging tools also find that the volume of prefrontal and hippocampal brain areas are larger in individuals who engaged in more physical activity earlier in life. We conclude from this review that there is convincing evidence that physical activity has a consistent and robust association with brain regions implicated in age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease. In addition to summarizing this literature we provide recommendations for future research on physical activity and brain health.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Physical activity (PA) has been hypothesized to spare gray matter volume in late adulthood, but longitudinal data testing an association has been lacking. Here we tested whether PA would be associated with greater gray matter volume after a 9-year follow-up, a threshold could be identified for the amount of walking necessary to spare gray matter volume, and greater gray matter volume associated with PA would be associated with a reduced risk for cognitive impairment 13 years after the PA evaluation. METHODS: In 299 adults (mean age 78 years) from the Cardiovascular Health Cognition Study, we examined the association between gray matter volume, PA, and cognitive impairment. Physical activity was quantified as the number of blocks walked over 1 week. High-resolution brain scans were acquired 9 years after the PA assessment on cognitively normal adults. White matter hyperintensities, ventricular grade, and other health variables at baseline were used as covariates. Clinical adjudication for cognitive impairment occurred 13 years after baseline. RESULTS: Walking amounts ranged from 0 to 300 blocks (mean 56.3; SD 69.7). Greater PA predicted greater volumes of frontal, occipital, entorhinal, and hippocampal regions 9 years later. Walking 72 blocks was necessary to detect increased gray matter volume but walking more than 72 blocks did not spare additional volume. Greater gray matter volume with PA reduced the risk for cognitive impairment 2-fold. CONCLUSION: Greater amounts of walking are associated with greater gray matter volume, which is in turn associated with a reduced risk of cognitive impairment.},

Here we conducted a voxel-based morphometry meta-analysis of published MRI data in stimulant-dependent individuals to clarify the most robust abnormalities underlying the disorder. We found that neuroimaging studies in stimulant-dependent individuals consistently report a gray matter decline in the prefrontal cortex regions associated with self-regulation and self-awareness. One of the next key questions that neuroimaging research today needs to address is the question of causality, namely to what extent these brain abnormalities are caused by the toxic effects of drug exposure, or the possibility that these may have predated drug-taking and even predisposed individuals for the development of drug dependence. Although the question of causality has not yet been answered completely, there has been significant progress made to date.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Type 2 diabetes increases the accumulation of brain white matter hyperintensities and loss of brain tissue. Behavioral interventions to promote weight loss through dietary changes and increased physical activity may delay these adverse consequences. We assessed whether participation in a successful 10-year lifestyle intervention was associated with better profiles of brain structure. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: At enrollment in the Action for Health in Diabetes clinical trial, participants had type 2 diabetes, were overweight or obese, and were aged 45-76 years. They were randomly assigned to receive 10 years of lifestyle intervention, which included group and individual counseling, or to a control group receiving diabetes support and education through group sessions on diet, physical activity, and social support. Following this intervention, 319 participants from three sites underwent standardized structural brain magnetic resonance imaging and tests of cognitive function 10-12 years after randomization. RESULTS: Total brain and hippocampus volumes were similar between intervention groups. The mean (SE) white matter hyperintensity volume was 28\% lower among lifestyle intervention participants compared with those receiving diabetes support and education: 1.59 (1.11) vs. 2.21 (1.11) cc (P = 0.02). The mean ventricle volume was 9\% lower: 28.93 (1.03) vs. 31.72 (1.03) cc (P = 0.04). Assignment to lifestyle intervention was not associated with consistent differences in cognitive function compared with diabetes support and education. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term weight loss intervention may reduce the adverse impact of diabetes on brain structure. Determining whether this eventually delays cognitive decline and impairment requires further research.},

  abstract = {To address the impact of COVID-19 olfactory loss on the brain, we analyzed the neural connectivity of the central olfactory system in recently SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects with persisting olfactory impairment (hyposmia). Twenty-seven previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects (10 males, mean age {$\pm$} SD 40.0 {$\pm$} 7.6 years) with clinically confirmed COVID-19 related hyposmia, and eighteen healthy, never SARS-CoV-2 infected, normosmic subjects (6 males, mean age {$\pm$} SD 36.0 {$\pm$} 7.1 years), were recruited in a 3 Tesla MRI study including high angular resolution diffusion and resting-state functional MRI acquisitions. Specialized metrics of structural and functional connectivity were derived from a standard parcellation of olfactory brain areas and a previously validated graph-theoretic model of the human olfactory functional network. These metrics were compared between groups and correlated to a clinical index of olfactory impairment. On the scanning day, all subjects were virus-free and cognitively unimpaired. Compared to control, both structural and functional connectivity metrics were found significantly increased in previously SARS-CoV-2 infected subjects. Greater residual olfactory impairment was associated with more segregated processing within regions more functionally connected to the anterior piriform cortex. An increased neural connectivity within the olfactory cortex was associated with a recent SARS-CoV-2 infection when the olfactory loss was a residual COVID-19 symptom. The functional connectivity of the anterior piriform cortex, the largest cortical recipient of afferent fibers from the olfactory bulb, accounted for the inter-individual variability in the sensory impairment. Albeit preliminary, these findings could feature a characteristic brain connectivity response in the presence of COVID-19 related residual hyposmia.},

Leptin therapy resulted in a rapid and sustained increase in plasma thyroid hormone levels and, through its age-dependent effects on gonadotropin secretion, facilitated appropriately timed pubertal development. Leptin deficiency was associated with reduced numbers of circulating CD4+ T cells and impaired T cell proliferation and cytokine release, all of which were reversed by recombinant human leptin administration.

We fit regression models with each CVP as an outcome, treating age, sex, and midlife risk factors as predictors.Results Women had significantly greater WMH volume relative to their WM volume compared to men (2.8\% vs 2.4\% of WM, p \&amp;lt; 0.001), while men had a greater frequency of cortical infarctions compared to women (9\% vs 4\%, p \&amp;lt; 0.001). Subcortical infarctions were equally common in men and women (20\%). In regression modeling after adjustment for WM volume, the mean WMH volume difference between men and women was of the same magnitude as a 7-year difference in age.

These sex differences persisted even after adjustment for midlife vascular risk factors.Conclusions There were important sex differences in CVP findings on FLAIR in cognitively unimpaired elderly. Understanding these sex differences could aid in the development of sex-specific preventive strategies.CI=confidence interval; CVP=cerebrovascular pathology; FLAIR=fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; ICD-9=International Classification of Diseases, 9th revision; MCSA=Mayo Clinic Study of Aging; OR=odds ratio; REP=Rochester Epidemiology Project; WM=white matter; WMH=white matter hyperintensities}

  abstract = {The structure and function of the human brain is closely related to cognitive processes of the mind and physiological processes of the body, suggesting that an intricate relationship exists between cognitive health, body health, and underlying neural architecture. In the current study, morphometric differences in cortical and subcortical gray matter regions, white matter integrity, and resting-state functional connectivity was assessed to determine what combinations of neural variables best explain an interconnected behavioral relationship between body mass index (BMI), general intelligence, and specific measures of executive function. Data for 82 subjects were obtained from the Nathan Kline Institute Rockland Sample. Behavioral results indicated a negative relationship between BMI and intelligence, which exhibited mediation by an inhibitory measure of executive function. Neural analyses further revealed generally contrasting associations of BMI, intelligence, and executive function with cortical morphometric regions important for inhibitory control and directed attention. Moreover, BMI related to morphometric alterations in components of a frontolimbic network, namely reduced thickness in the anterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial prefrontal cortex, whereas intelligence and inhibitory control primarily related to increased thickness and volume in parietal regions, as well as significantly increased across-network connectivity of visual and default mode resting-state networks. These results propose that medial prefrontal structure and interconnected frontolimbic and frontoparietal networks are important to consider in the relationship between BMI, intelligence, and executive function.}

With a 1.5-MR unit we studied 12 Alzheimer patients, four subjects suffering from multiinfarct dementia and nine age-matched controls. Punctate or early confluent high-signal abnormalities in the deep white matter, noted in 60\% of both Alzheimer patients and controls, were unrelated to the presence of hypertension or other vascular risk factors. A significant number of Alzheimer patients exhibited a more extensive smooth "halo" of periventricular hyperintensity when compared with controls (p = .024). Widespread deep white-matter hyperintensity (two patients) and extensive, irregular periventricular hyperintensity (three patients) were seen in multiinfarct dementia. Areas of high signal intensity affecting hippocampal and sylvian cortex were also present in five Alzheimer and two multiinfarct dementia patients, but absent in controls. Discrete, small foci of deep white-matter hyperintensity are not characteristic of Alzheimer's disease nor do they appear to imply a vascular cause for the dementing illness. The frequently observed "halo" of periventricular hyperintensity in Alzheimer's disease may be of diagnostic importance. High-signal abnormalities in specific cortical regions are likely to reflect disease processes localized to those structures.},

  abstract = {The world is aging and, as the elderly population increases, age-related cognitive decline emerges as a major concern. Neuroimaging techniques, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), allow the investigation of the neural bases of age-related cognitive changes in vivo. Typically, fMRI studies map brain activity while subjects perform cognitive tasks, but such paradigms are often difficult to implement on a wider basis. Resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) has emerged as an important alternative modality of fMRI data acquisition, during which no specific task is required. Due to such simplicity and the reliability of rs-fMRI data, this modality presents increased feasibility and potential for clinical application in the future. With rs-fMRI, fluctuations in regional brain activity can be detected across separate brain regions and the patterns of intercorrelation between the functioning of these regions are measured, affording quantitative indices of resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC). This review article summarizes the results of recent rs-fMRI studies that have documented a variety of aging-related RSFC changes in the human brain, discusses the neurophysiological hypotheses proposed to interpret such findings, and provides an overview of the future, highly promising perspectives in this field.},

Four hundred twenty-three clinically diagnosed AD patients were included (161 typical, 121 limbic-predominant, 70 hippocampal-sparing, 71 minimal atrophy). One hundred fifty-six fulfilled a biomarkers-based AD diagnosis. White matter hyperintensities and cerebral microbleeds (CMB) had the highest prevalence in limbic-predominant AD, and the lowest prevalence in minimal atrophy AD. CMB existed evenly in lobar and deep brain areas in limbic-predominant, typical, and hippocampal-sparing AD. In minimal atrophy AD, CMB were mainly located in brain lobar areas. Perivascular spaces in the centrum semiovale were more prevalent in typical AD. Small vessel disease contributed to the prediction of Mini-Mental State Examination. Minimal atrophy AD showed highly pathological levels of cerebrospinal fluid A{\ss}1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau, in the absence of overt brain atrophy. Cerebral amyloid angiopathy seems to have a stronger contribution to hippocampal-sparing and minimal atrophy AD, whereas hypertensive arteriopathy may have a stronger contribution to typical and limbic-predominant AD.},

We determined the contribution of each of these conditions to diffusion alterations. METHODS: We studied six samples (N = 365 participants) covering the spectrum of AD and SVD, including genetically defined samples. We calculated diffusion measures from DTI and free water imaging. Simple linear, multivariable random forest, and voxel-based regressions were used to evaluate associations between AD biomarkers (amyloid beta, tau), SVD imaging markers, and diffusion measures. RESULTS: SVD markers were strongly associated with diffusion measures and showed a higher contribution than AD biomarkers in multivariable analysis across all memory clinic samples. Voxel-wise analyses between tau and diffusion measures were not significant. DISCUSSION: In memory clinic patients, the effect of SVD on diffusion alterations largely exceeds the effect of AD, supporting the value of diffusion measures as markers of SVD.},

  abstract = {Does accelerated cortical atrophy in aging, especially in areas vulnerable to early Alzheimer's disease (AD), unequivocally signify neurodegenerative disease or can it be part of normal aging? We addressed this in 3 ways. First, age trajectories of cortical thickness were delineated cross-sectionally (n = 1100) and longitudinally (n = 207). Second, effects of undetected AD on the age trajectories were simulated by mixing the sample with a sample of patients with very mild to moderate AD. Third, atrophy in AD-vulnerable regions was examined in older adults with very low probability of incipient AD based on 2-year neuropsychological stability, CSF A{$\beta$}1-42 levels, and apolipoprotein {$\varepsilon$}4 negativity. Steady decline was seen in most regions, but accelerated cortical thinning in entorhinal cortex was observed across groups. Very low-risk older adults had longitudinal entorhinal atrophy rates similar to other healthy older adults, and this atrophy was predictive of memory change. While steady decline in cortical thickness is the norm in aging, acceleration in AD-prone regions does not uniquely signify neurodegenerative illness but can be part of healthy aging. The relationship between the entorhinal changes and changes in memory performance suggests that non-AD mechanisms in AD-prone areas may still be causative for cognitive reductions.}

  abstract = {Abstract Extensive efforts are devoted to understand the functional (FC) and structural connections (SC) of the brain. FC is usually measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and conceptualized as degree of synchronicity in brain activity between different regions. SC is typically indexed by measures of white matter (WM) properties, for example, by diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). FC and SC are intrinsically related, in that coordination of activity across regions ultimately depends on fast and efficient transfer of information made possible by structural connections. Convergence between FC and SC has been shown for specific networks, especially the default mode network (DMN). However, it is not known to what degree FC is constrained by major WM tracts and whether FC and SC change together over time. Here, 120 participants (20?85 years) were tested at two time points, separated by 3.3 years. Resting?state fMRI was used to measure FC, and DWI to measure WM microstructure as an index of SC. TRACULA, part of FreeSurfer, was used for automated tractography of 18 major WM tracts. Cortical regions with tight structural couplings defined by tractography were only weakly related at the functional level. Certain regions of the DMN showed a modest relationship between change in FC and SC, but for the most part, the two measures changed independently. The main conclusions are that anatomical alignment of SC and FC seems restricted to specific networks and tracts, and that changes in SC and FC are not necessarily strongly correlated.

  abstract = {Episodic memories are established and maintained by close interplay between hippocampus and other cortical regions, but degradation of a fronto-striatal network has been suggested to be a driving force of memory decline in aging. We wanted to directly address how changes in hippocampal-cortical versus striatal-cortical networks over time impact episodic memory with age. We followed 119 healthy participants (20{\textendash}83 years) for 3.5 years with repeated tests of episodic verbal memory and magnetic resonance imaging for quantification of functional and structural connectivity and regional brain atrophy. While hippocampal-cortical functional connectivity predicted memory change in young, changes in cortico-striatal functional connectivity were related to change in recall in older adults. Within each age group, effects of functional and structural connectivity were anatomically closely aligned. Interestingly, the relationship between functional connectivity and memory was strongest in the age ranges where the rate of reduction of the relevant brain structure was lowest, implying selective impacts of the different brain events on memory. Together, these findings suggest a partly sequential and partly simultaneous model of brain events underlying cognitive changes in aging, where different functional and structural events are more or less important in various time windows, dismissing a simple uni-factorial view on neurocognitive aging.}

  abstract = {Higher order speeded cognitive abilities depend on efficient coordination of activity across the brain, rendering them vulnerable to age reductions in structural and functional brain connectivity. The concept of ``disconnected aging'' has been invoked, suggesting that degeneration of connections between distant brain regions cause cognitive reductions. However, it has not been shown that changes in cognitive functions over time can be explained by simultaneous changes in brain connectivity. We followed 119 young and middle-aged (23{\textendash}52 years) and older (63{\textendash}86 years) adults for 3.3 years with repeated assessments of structural and functional brain connectivity and executive functions. We found unique age-related longitudinal reductions in executive function over and above changes in more basic cognitive processes. Intriguingly, 82.5\% of the age-related decline in executive function could be explained by changes in connectivity over time. While both structural and functional connectivity changes were related to longitudinal reductions in executive function, only structural connectivity change could explain the age-specific decline. This suggests that the major part of the age-related reductions in executive function can be attributed to micro- and macrostructural alterations in brain connectivity. Although correlational in nature, we believe the present results constitute evidence for a ``disconnected brain'' view on cognitive aging.}

Blood oxygen level dependent fMRI was performed evaluating encoding-associated signal and resting-state default mode network signal differences between the two risk groups. Neurocognitive testing revealed that the high risk group performed worse on category fluency testing, but the groups were equivalent on all other cognitive measures. During encoding of novel face-name pairs, there were no regions of encoding-associated BOLD activations that were different in the high risk group. Encoding-associated deactivations were greater in magnitude in the low risk group in the medial and right lateral parietal cortex, similar to findings in AD studies. The resting-state DMN analysis demonstrated nine regions in the prefrontal, orbital frontal, temporal and parietal lobes that distinguished the two risk groups. Resting-state DMN analysis could distinguish risk groups with an effect size of 3.35, compared to an effect size of 1.39 using encoding-associated fMRI techniques. Imaging of the resting state avoids performance related variability seen in activation fMRI, is less complicated to acquire and standardize, does not require radio-isotopes, and may be more effective at identifying functional pathology associated with AD risk compared to non-resting fMRI techniques.},

No clear consensus has yet emerged on the validity of the concept of food addiction and whether some individuals who struggle to control their food intake can be considered food addicts. Some, including Fletcher, have argued that the concept of food addiction is unsupported, as many of the defining features of drug addiction are not seen in the context of feeding behaviors. Others, Kenny included, have argued that food and drug addiction share similar features that may reflect common underlying neural mechanisms.

The hypothalamus is a master regulator of endocrine and metabolic control. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the hypothalamic volume would be associated to metabolic parameters in ALL survivors. Thirty-eight (21 women) survivors participated in this study 34 years after diagnosis and with a median age of 38 (27-46) years. All were treated with a median CRT dose of 24 Gy and 11 years (3-13) of complete hormone supplementation. Comparisons were made to 31 matched controls. We performed analyses of fat mass, fat free mass, plasma (p)-glucose, p-insulin, Homa-Index (a measure of insulin resistance), serum (s)-leptin, s-ghrelin and of the hypothalamic volume in scans obtained by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3 Tesla. Serum leptin/kg fat mass (r = -0.4, P = 0.04) and fat mass (r = -0.4, P = 0.01) were negatively correlated with the HT volume among ALL survivors, but not among controls. We also detected significantly higher BMI, waist, fat mass, p-insulin, Homa-Index, leptin/kg fat mass and s-ghrelin and significantly lower fat free mass specifically among female ALL survivors (all P{$<$}0.01). Interestingly, s-ghrelin levels increased with time since diagnosis and with low age at diagnosis for childhood ALL. Our results showed that leptin/kg fat mass and fat mass were associated with a reduced HT volume 34 years after ALL diagnosis and that women treated with CRT after ALL are at high risk of metabolic abnormalities. Taken together our data suggest that the hypothalamus is involved in the metabolic consequences after CRT in ALL survivors. FAU - Follin, Cecilia},

However, in recent years research has been conducted to estimate the impact of obesity on HRQL, and to determine the effects of weight reduction on HRQL. The majority of published studies indicate that obesity impairs HRQL, and that higher degrees of obesity are associated with greater impairment. Obesity?associated decrements on HRQL tend to be most pronounced on physical domains of functioning. Studies of the effect of obesity surgery among morbidly obese patients indicate that this procedure produces significant and sustained improvements in the majority of HRQL indices; among mild?to?moderately obese persons, modest weight reduction derived from lifestyle modification also appears to improve HRQL, at least in the short term. Additional research is needed to (1) further characterize the effect that obesity has on HRQL; (2) estimate the short? and long?term effects of various methods of weight reduction (e.g. surgery, lifestyle modification) on HRQL; (3) improve both the conceptualization and measurement of HRQL to incorporate the personal preferences and values of the patient; and (4) develop ways to enhance and sustain positive changes in HRQL, even if weight maintenance is elusive.},

To evaluate the hypothesis that visceral fat promotes systemic inflammation by secreting inflammatory adipokines into the portal circulation that drains visceral fat, we determined adipokine arteriovenous concentration differences across visceral fat, by obtaining portal vein and radial artery blood samples, in 25 extremely obese subjects (mean {$\pm$} SD BMI 54.7 {$\pm$} 12.6 kg/m2) during gastric bypass surgery at Barnes-Jewish Hospital in St. Louis, Missouri. Mean plasma interleukin (IL)-6 concentration was {$\sim$}50\% greater in the portal vein than in the radial artery in obese subjects (P = 0.007). Portal vein IL-6 concentration correlated directly with systemic C-reactive protein concentrations (r = 0.544, P = 0.005). Mean plasma leptin concentration was {$\sim$}20\% lower in the portal vein than in the radial artery in obese subjects (P = 0.0002). Plasma tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}, resistin, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, and adiponectin concentrations were similar in the portal vein and radial artery in obese subjects. These data suggest that visceral fat is an important site for IL-6 secretion and provide a potential mechanistic link between visceral fat and systemic inflammation in people with abdominal obesity.}

Such unwanted sources of variation, which we refer to as ``scanner effects'', can hinder the detection of imaging features associated with clinical covariates of interest and cause spurious findings. In this paper, we investigate scanner effects in two large multi-site studies on cortical thickness measurements across a total of 11 scanners. We propose a set of tools for visualizing and identifying scanner effects that are generalizable to other modalities. We then propose to use ComBat, a technique adopted from the genomics literature and recently applied to diffusion tensor imaging data, to combine and harmonize cortical thickness values across scanners. We show that ComBat removes unwanted sources of scan variability while simultaneously increasing the power and reproducibility of subsequent statistical analyses. We also show that ComBat is useful for combining imaging data with the goal of studying life-span trajectories in the brain.},

One network consists of regions routinely exhibiting task-related activations and the other of regions routinely exhibiting task-related deactivations. This intrinsic organization, featuring the presence of anticorrelated networks in the absence of overt task performance, provides a critical context in which to understand brain function.

Methods and Results A total of 2036 participants were divided into four groups according to their systolic blood pressure (SBP) at biennial examination 10, 11, or 12. After excluding subjects receiving antihypertensive drug therapy, up to 30 years of data on normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects from biennial examinations 2 through 16 were used. Regressions of blood pressure versus age within individual subjects produced slope and curvature estimates that were compared with the use of ANOVA among the four SBP groups. There was a linear rise in SBP from age 30 through 84 years and concurrent increases in diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP); after age 50 to 60 years, DBP declined, pulse pressure (PP) rose steeply, and MAP reached an asymptote. Neither the fall in DBP nor the rise in PP was influenced significantly by removal of subsequent deaths and subjects with nonfatal myocardial infarction or heart failure. Age-related linear increases in SBP, PP, and MAP, as well as the early rise and late fall in DBP, were greatest for subjects with the highest baseline SBP; this represents a divergent rather than parallel tracking pattern. Conclusions The late fall in DBP after age 60 years, associated with a continual rise in SBP, cannot be explained by ``burned out'' diastolic hypertension or by ``selective survivorship'' but is consistent with increased large artery stiffness. Higher SBP, left untreated, may accelerate large artery stiffness and thus perpetuate a vicious cycle.},

We found that bioRxiv-deposited journal articles received a sizeable citation and altmetric advantage over non-deposited articles. Regression analysis reveals that this advantage is not explained by multiple explanatory variables related to the article and its authorship. bioRxiv preprints themselves are being directly cited in journal articles, regardless of whether the preprint has been subsequently published in a journal. bioRxiv preprints are also shared widely on Twitter and in blogs, but remain relatively scarce in mainstream media and Wikipedia articles, in comparison to peer-reviewed journal articles.}

  abstract = {Our current knowledge of risk factors for Alzheimer's disease is limited and primarily addresses early-onset disease. This study aimed to determine the risk factors for late-onset Alzheimer's disease using a case-control approach. Ninety-eight cases and 216 controls were gathered from an ongoing population survey on aging and dementia in Stockholm (the Kungsholmen Project). We found a high relative risk (3.2; 95\% confidence interval, 1.8-5.7) with the presence of at least one first-degree relative affected by dementia. Among all the other risk factors, alcohol abuse (relative risk, 4.4; 95\% confidence interval, 1.4-13.8) and manual work (relative risk for men of 5.3; 95\% confidence interval, 1.1-25.5) emerged as positively associated. No clear association was found with a family history of Parkinson disease, advanced parental age at index delivery, season of birth, or previous head trauma. In conclusion, our data suggest that the main risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer's disease is a family history of dementia, as has been previously reported for early-onset disease. Moreover, alcohol abuse and occupational exposure might play a specific role for this form of the disease.},

  abstract = {Abstract In the present report, estimates of test?retest and between-site reliability of fMRI assessments were produced in the context of a multicenter fMRI reliability study (FBIRN Phase 1, www.nbirn.net). Five subjects were scanned on 10 MRI scanners on two occasions. The fMRI task was a simple block design sensorimotor task. The impulse response functions to the stimulation block were derived using an FIR-deconvolution analysis with FMRISTAT. Six functionally-derived ROIs covering the visual, auditory and motor cortices, created from a prior analysis, were used. Two dependent variables were compared: percent signal change and contrast-to-noise-ratio. Reliability was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients derived from a variance components analysis. Test?retest reliability was high, but initially, between-site reliability was low, indicating a strong contribution from site and site-by-subject variance. However, a number of factors that can markedly improve between-site reliability were uncovered, including increasing the size of the ROIs, adjusting for smoothness differences, and inclusion of additional runs. By employing multiple steps, between-site reliability for 3T scanners was increased by 123\%. Dropping one site at a time and assessing reliability can be a useful method of assessing the sensitivity of the results to particular sites. These findings should provide guidance toothers on the best practices for future multicenter studies. Hum Brain Mapp, 2008. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Here, we used multivariate techniques to investigate the associations between cardiovascular health (diastolic blood pressure, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate) and white matter macrostructure (lesion volume and number) and microstructure (as measured by diffusion-weighted imaging) in the cross-sectional, population-based Cam-CAN cohort (N~= 667, aged 18{\textendash}88). We found that cardiovascular health and age made approximately similar contributions to white matter health and explained up to 56\% of variance therein. Lower diastolic blood pressure, higher systolic blood pressure, and higher heart rate were each strongly, and independently, associated with white matter abnormalities on all indices. Body mass and exercise were associated with white matter health, both directly and indirectly via cardiovascular health. These results highlight the importance of cardiovascular risk factors for white matter health across the adult lifespan and suggest that systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate affect white matter health via separate mechanisms.},

Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery is one of the most efficient procedures for the treatment of morbid obesity resulting in drastic weight loss and improvement of metabolic and inflammatory status. We analyzed the impact of RYGB on the modifications of gut microbiota and examined links with adaptations associated with this procedure. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Gut microbiota was profiled from fecal samples by real-time quantitative PCR in 13 lean control subjects and in 30 obese individuals (with seven type 2 diabetics) explored before (M0), 3 months (M3), and 6 months (M6) after RYGB. RESULTS Four major findings are highlighted: 1) Bacteroides/Prevotella group was lower in obese subjects than in control subjects at M0 and increased at M3. It was negatively correlated with corpulence, but the correlation depended highly on caloric intake; 2) Escherichia coli species increased at M3 and inversely correlated with fat mass and leptin levels independently of changes in food intake; 3) lactic acid bacteria including Lactobacillus/Leuconostoc/Pediococcus group and Bifidobacterium genus decreased at M3; and 4) Faecalibacterium prausnitzii species was lower in subjects with diabetes and associated negatively with inflammatory markers at M0 and throughout the follow-up after surgery independently of changes in food intake. CONCLUSIONS These results suggest that components of the dominant gut microbiota rapidly adapt in a starvation-like situation induced by RYGB while the F. prausnitzii species is directly linked to the reduction in low-grade inflammation state in obesity and diabetes independently of calorie intake.}

  abstract = {Obesity is a major health problem in modern societies. It has been related to abnormal functional organization of brain networks believed to process homeostatic (internal) and/or salience (external) information. This study used resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging analysis to delineate possible functional changes in brain networks related to obesity. A group of 18 healthy adult participants with obesity were compared with a group of 16 lean participants while performing a resting-state task, with the data being evaluated by independent component analysis. Participants also completed a neuropsychological assessment. Results showed that the functional connectivity strength of the putamen nucleus in the salience network was increased in the obese group. We speculate that this abnormal activation may contribute to overeating through an imbalance between autonomic processing and reward processing of food stimuli. A correlation was also observed in obesity between activation of the putamen nucleus in the salience network and mental slowness, which is consistent with the notion that basal ganglia circuits modulate rapid processing of information.},

To overcome this issue, we conducted a meta-analysis on voxel-based morphometry (VBM) differences associated with obesity-related variables and validated the findings with an independent dataset. METHODS: The literature search included combinations of the following key words: (i) neuroimaging terms: MRI, gray matter, brain, magnetic resonance; (ii) obesity-related terms: obesity, obese, body mass, waist circumference, adiposity. We conducted the meta-analysis using Anisotropic Effect-Size Seed-Based d Mapping (AES-SDM) software. Twenty-one studies on obesity and VBM fulfilled our inclusion criteria, representing 5882 participants (54\% females) aged 18-92 years. To examine the validity of our meta-analytic results, we additionally tested on an independent dataset (Human Connectome Project, n = 378 participants) whether mean VBM values obtained for each cluster showed correlations with body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: We found that obesity-related variables were consistently associated with lower gray matter volume in areas including the medial prefrontal cortex, bilateral cerebellum, and left temporal pole. The clusters showed negative associations between gray matter volume and BMI in the independent dataset, with the exception of one cluster in the cerebellum. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide robust evidence that obesity and body mass are related to significantly lower gray matter volume in brain areas with a key role in executive control.

  abstract = {Introduction White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are often described in Alzheimer's disease (AD), but their topography and specific relationships with cognition remain unclear. Methods Regional WMH were estimated in 54 cognitively impaired amyloid beta{\textendash}positive AD (A{$\beta$}pos-AD), compared to 40 cognitively unimpaired amyloid beta{\textendash}negative older controls (A{$\beta$}neg-controls) matched for vascular risk factors. The cross-sectional association between regional WMH volume and cognition was assessed within each group, controlling for cerebral amyloid burden, global cortical atrophy, and hippocampal atrophy. Results WMH volume was larger in A{$\beta$}pos-AD compared to A{$\beta$}neg-controls in all regions, with the greatest changes in the splenium of the corpus callosum (S-CC). In A{$\beta$}pos-AD patients, larger total and regional WMH volume, especially in the S-CC, was strongly associated with decreased cognition. Discussion WMH specifically contribute to lower cognition in AD, independently from amyloid deposition and atrophy. This study emphasizes the clinical relevance of WMH in AD, especially posterior WMH, and most notably S-CC WMH.},

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH), frequently seen in older adults, are usually considered vascular lesions, and participate in the vascular contribution to cognitive impairment and dementia. However, emerging evidence highlights the heterogeneity of WMH pathophysiology, suggesting that non-vascular mechanisms could also be involved, notably in Alzheimer's disease (AD). This led to the alternative hypothesis that in AD, part of WMH may be secondary to AD-related processes. The current perspective brings together the arguments from different fields of research, including neuropathology, neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers, and genetics, in favor of this alternative hypothesis. Possible underlying mechanisms leading to AD-related WMH, such as AD-related neurodegeneration or neuroinflammation, are discussed, as well as implications for diagnostic criteria and management of AD. We finally discuss ways to test this hypothesis and remaining challenges. Acknowledging the heterogeneity of WMH and the existence of AD-related WMH may improve personalized diagnosis and care of patients.},

Multivariate regression models suggested that the association of higher levels of physical activity with lower levels of inflammation markers may be mediated by body mass index and glucose. There was no association between physical activity and albumin. Higher levels of physical activity were associated with lower concentrations of four out of five inflammation markers in this elderly cohort. These data suggest that increased exercise is associated with reduced inflammation. Prospective studies will be required for verification of these findings.}

The objective of this study was to investigate current levels of compliance with these guidelines for inclusion, analysis, and reporting in NIH-funded randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and compare the results with those from 2009 and 2004, which the authors reported previously. METHOD: The authors identified 782 RCTs published in 14 leading U.S. medical journals in 2015 with a PubMed search. Of those, 142 were the primary report of an NIH-funded RCT, conducted in the United States, and eligible for analysis. The authors reviewed abstract, text, and tables of each eligible study as well as any follow-up published commentary to determine compliance with NIH guidelines. RESULTS: Thirty-five studies limited enrollment to one sex. The median enrollment of women in the remaining 107 studies was 46\%, but 16 (15.0\%) enrolled less than 30\% women. Twenty-eight of the 107 (26\%) reported at least one outcome by sex or explicitly included sex as a covariate in statistical analysis. Of the 142 studies, 19 (13.4\%) analyzed or reported outcomes by race or ethnicity. There were no statistically significant changes in inclusion, analysis, or reporting by sex, race, or ethnicity compared with the previous studies. CONCLUSIONS: NIH policies have not resulted in significant increases in reporting results by sex, race, or ethnicity. The authors recommend strong journal policies to increase compliance with NIH policies.},

The post-surgery increase in cognitive control might correspond with a decrease of impulsive symptoms after surgery. The present study investigated cognitive function and nonfood-related impulsivity in patients with substantial weight loss due to bariatric surgery by using a comparative cross-sectional design. Fifty post-bariatric surgery patients (postBS group) who had significant percent weight loss (M = 75.94, SD = 18.09) after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (body mass index, BMI M\textsubscript{post} = 30.54 kg/m\textsuperscript{2}, SD\textsubscript{post} = 5.14) were compared with 50 age and gender matched bariatric surgery candidates (preBS group; BMI M\textsubscript{pre} = 48.01 kg/m\textsuperscript{2}, SD\textsubscript{pre} = 6.56). To measure cognitive function the following computer-assisted behavioral tasks were utilized: Iowa Gambling Task, Tower of Hanoi, Stroop Test, Trail Making Test-Part B, and Corsi Block Tapping Test. Impulsive symptoms and behaviors were assessed using impulsivity questionnaires and a structured interview for impulse control disorders (ICDs). No group differences were found with regard to performance-based cognitive control, self-reported impulsive symptoms, and ICDs. The results indicate that the general tendency to react impulsively does not differ between pre-surgery and post-surgery patients. The question of whether nonfood-related impulsivity in morbidly obese patients changes post-surgery should be addressed in longitudinal studies given that impulsive symptoms can be considered potential targets for pre- as well post-surgery interventions.}

Here, we show by bioinformatics analysis that FTO shares sequence motifs with Fe(II)- and 2-oxoglutarate{\textendash}dependent oxygenases. We find that recombinant murine Fto catalyzes the Fe(II)- and 2OG-dependent demethylation of 3-methylthymine in single-stranded DNA, with concomitant production of succinate, formaldehyde, and carbon dioxide. Consistent with a potential role in nucleic acid demethylation, Fto localizes to the nucleus in transfected cells. Studies of wild-type mice indicate that Fto messenger RNA (mRNA) is most abundant in the brain, particularly in hypothalamic nuclei governing energy balance, and that Fto mRNA levels in the arcuate nucleus are regulated by feeding and fasting. Studies can now be directed toward determining the physiologically relevant FTO substrate and how nucleic acid methylation status is linked to increased fat mass.}

The aim of the present review was a comprehensive and critical evaluation of the existing literature taking into account the methodological quality of studies to enhance our understanding of personality traits associated with body weight, the development of overweight and obesity as well as the effectiveness of weight loss interventions including bariatric surgery. Personality traits play an important role both as risk as well as protective factors in the development of overweight and obesity. While thus in particular ?neuroticism?, ?impulsivity? and ?sensitivity to reward? appear as risk factors, ?conscientiousness? and ?self?control? have been shown to have a protective function in relation to weight gain. Conscientiousness is a measure of regulation of internal urges and self?discipline, and may thus provide a potential source of control over impulsive reward?oriented behaviour. The results of the present review suggest that, within the context of therapeutic weight reduction measures, it is meaningful to identify subgroups of patients for whom specific treatment options need to be developed, such as measures for strengthening self?control skills.},

Some developmental, pathological, and dementing diseases are associated with alterations in normal anatomical asymmetries.

Recent evidence indicates that the allele {$\epsilon$}4 of the apolipoprotein E (ApoE), a well known risk factor for Alzheimer\&\#039;s disease, might play a part in determining some brain morphological changes both in normal carriers and in patients with Alzheimer\&\#039;s disease. This study evaluated the effect of the ApoE genotype on hippocampal asymmetry in patients with Alzheimer\&\#039;s disease carrying 0, 1, and 2 copies of the allele. Volumetric right-left differences of the hippocampi were computed in 28 right handed patients with Alzheimer\&\#039;s disease (14 -/-, 9 {$\epsilon$}4/-, and 5 {$\epsilon$}4/4) and 30 controls without detectable cognitive deficit. In controls, the right hippocampus was larger than the left, whereas in patients with Alzheimer\&\#039;s disease this asymmetry was progressively reduced with increasing gene dose of the {$\epsilon$}4 allele, and the asymmetry was reversed in the {$\epsilon$}4/4 Alzheimer\&\#039;s disease group. The mean right-left volume differences were: 1.2, 0.7, 0.2, and -1.0 in controls, -/-, {$\epsilon$}4/-, and {$\epsilon$}4/4 patients, respectively (sex adjusted p for trend=0.017).

This study investigates whether a composite executive function measure based on these multiple indicators has better psychometric characteristics than the widely used individual components. We applied item response theory methods to 800 ADNI participants to derive an EF composite score (ADNI-EF) from the above measures. We then compared ADNI-EF with component measures in 390 longitudinally-followed participants with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) with respect to: (1) Ability to detect change over time; (2) Ability to predict conversion to dementia; (3) Strength of cross-sectional association with MRI-derived measures of structures involved in frontal systems, and (4) Strength of baseline association with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of amyloid {$\beta$}1-42, total tau, and phosphorylated tau181P. ADNI-EF showed the greatest change over time, followed closely by Category Fluency. ADNI-EF needed a 40~\% smaller sample size to detect change. ADNI-EF was the strongest predictor of AD conversion. ADNI-EF was the only measure significantly associated with all the MRI regions, though other measures were more strongly associated in a few of the regions. ADNI-EF was associated with all the CSF measures. ADNI-EF appears to be a useful composite measure of EF in MCI, as good as or better than any of its composite parts. This study demonstrates an approach to developing a psychometrically sophisticated composite score from commonly-used tests.}

METHODS: Ten patients with amnesic mild cognitive impairment (a-MCI), 11 patients with probable AD and 10 healthy controls were recruited. T1 volumes were obtained from each subject and postprocessed according to an optimised voxel based morphometry protocol. Resting state functional MRI data were also collected from the same individuals and analysed to produce connectivity maps after identification of the default mode network (DMN) by independent component analysis. RESULTS: Compared with healthy controls, both AD and a-MCI patients showed a similar regional pattern of brain disconnection between the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and the medial prefrontal cortex and the rest of the brain. Conversely, the distribution of GM atrophy was significantly more restricted in a-MCI than in AD patients. Interestingly, the PCC showed reduced connectivity in a-MCI patients in the absence of GM atrophy, which was, in contrast, detectable at the stage of fully developed AD. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that disconnection precedes GM atrophy in the PCC, which is a critical area of the DMN, and supports the hypothesis that GM atrophy in specific regions of AD brains likely reflects a long term effect of brain disconnection. In this context, our study indicates that GM atrophy in PCC accompanies the conversion from MCI to AD.},

  abstract = {The default-mode network, a coherent resting-state brain network, is thought to characterize basal neural activity. Aberrant default-mode connectivity has been reported in a host of neurological and psychiatric illnesses and in persons at genetic risk for such illnesses. Whereas the neurophysiologic mechanisms that regulate default-mode connectivity are unclear, there is growing evidence that genetic factors play a role. In this report, we estimate the importance of genetic effects on the default-mode network by examining covariation patterns in functional connectivity among 333 individuals from 29 randomly selected extended pedigrees. Heritability for default-mode functional connectivity was 0.424 +/- 0.17 (P = 0.0046). Although neuroanatomic variation in this network was also heritable, the genetic factors that influence default-mode functional connectivity and gray-matter density seem to be distinct, suggesting that unique genes influence the structure and function of the network. In contrast, significant genetic correlations between regions within the network provide evidence that the same genetic factors contribute to variation in functional connectivity throughout the default mode. Specifically, the left parahippocampal region was genetically correlated with all other network regions. In addition, the posterior cingulate/precuneus region, medial prefrontal cortex, and right cerebellum seem to form a subnetwork. Default-mode functional connectivity is influenced by genetic factors that cannot be attributed to anatomic variation or a single region within the network. By establishing the heritability of default-mode functional connectivity, this experiment provides the obligatory evidence required before these measures can be considered as endophenotypes for psychiatric or neurological illnesses or to identify genes influencing intrinsic brain function.},

  abstract = {The D2 dopamine receptor mediates neuropsychiatric symptoms and is a target of pharmacotherapy. Inter-individual variation of D2 receptor density is thought to influence disease risk and pharmacological response. Numerous molecular imaging studies have tested whether common genetic variants influence D2 receptor binding potential (BP) in humans, but demonstration of robust effects has been limited by small sample sizes. We performed a systematic search of published human in vivo molecular imaging studies to estimate effect sizes of common genetic variants on striatal D2 receptor BP. We identified 21 studies examining 19 variants in 11 genes. The most commonly studied variant was a single-nucleotide polymorphism in ANKK1 (rs1800497, Glu713Lys, also called /`Taq1A/'). Fixed- and random-effects meta-analyses of this variant (5 studies, 194 subjects total) revealed that striatal BP was significantly and robustly lower among carriers of the minor allele (Lys713) relative to major allele homozygotes. The weighted standardized mean difference was -0.57 under the fixed-effect model (95\% confidence interval=(-0.87, -0.27), P=0.0002). The normal relationship between rs1800497 and BP was not apparent among subjects with neuropsychiatric diseases. Significant associations with baseline striatal D2 receptor BP have been reported for four DRD2 variants (rs1079597, rs1076560, rs6277 and rs1799732) and a PER2 repeat polymorphism, but none have yet been tested in more than two independent samples. Our findings resolve apparent discrepancies in the literature and establish that rs1800497 robustly influences striatal D2 receptor availability. This genetic variant is likely to contribute to important individual differences in human striatal function, neuropsychiatric disease risk and pharmacological response.}

Few studies, however, have assessed the combined association of these changes on the severity of future cognitive decline. In the prospective population-based 3C-Dijon MRI study, 1701 non-demented participants aged 65 to 80 years at entry had a brain MRI. Information on WML, hippocampal volumes, SBI presence, and brain parenchymal fraction were obtained. At 4-year follow-up, participants were screened for cognitive decline and dementia. Severity of cognitive decline was defined as none, moderate, or severe calculated from neuropsychological test performance change. The relation between brain MRI markers and longitudinal change in cognition was studied using polytomous logistic regression and multiple linear regression models controlling for potential confounders. Two-by-two interactions were tested including with the apolipoprotein E genotype. At follow-up, 46 participants showed severe cognitive deterioration and 224 participants showed moderate cognitive deterioration. In multivariable analyses, risk of severe cognitive deterioration as well as the cognitive decline rate were significantly increased in participants with higher WML volume (p{$<$} 0.01) and smaller hippocampal volume (p{$<$} 0.01). The results suggested that WML and hippocampal volumes had a cumulative effect on the future level of cognitive decline. The APOE genotype was found to be an effect modifier of this association. Vascular brain changes and degenerative processes coexist in normal older individuals. The co-occurrence of degenerative and non-degenerative pathologies could strongly affect the course of dementia expression.},

This study examines the longitudinal relationship between depression and white matter lesions (WML) in a sample of elderly aged 65 years and older. Methods Three City (3C)-Dijon is a 4-year follow-up population-based prospective study of 1658 subjects. At baseline, lifetime major depressive episode diagnosis was established using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview. At each study wave, severity of depressive symptoms was assessed using Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D), and antidepressants intake was recorded. At baseline, lifetime major depression (LMD) was defined as lifetime major depressive episode or antidepressant medication intake. At follow-up, subjects were classified ``incident depression'' if scoring high at CES-D or antidepressant users. At baseline, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to quantify WML volumes using an automated method of detection. At 4-year follow-up, 1214 subjects had a second MRI. Results Cross-sectional analysis showed a significantly higher WML volume in subjects with LMD compared with other subjects. Adjusted longitudinal analysis showed that increase in WML load was significantly higher in subjects with baseline LMD (2.1 cm3 vs. 1.5 cm3, p = .004). Among subjects free of depression up to baseline (n = 956), the higher the baseline WML volume, the higher the risk of developing depression during follow-up (odds ratio one quartile increase: 1.3; 95\% confidence interval: = 1.1{\textendash}1.7). Conclusions Our data show that depression and WML volumes are strongly related. These results are consistent with the hypothesis of a vascular depression in the elderly.},

We critically discuss the analytical techniques used in the literature. Results In total 137 publications were included in the qualitative synthesis. Three techniques were identified as the most commonly used methodologies: machine learning, logistic regression, and Cox regression. Discussion We identified three major methodological weaknesses: (1) over-reliance on one data source, (2) poor verification of statistical assumptions of Cox and logistic regression, and (3) lack of validation. The use of larger and more diverse data sets is recommended. Assumptions should be tested thoroughly, and actions should be taken if deviations are detected.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Chronic subacute inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Salicylates were shown years ago to lower glucose and more recently to inhibit NF-kappaB activity. Salsalate, a prodrug form of salicylate, has seen extensive clinical use and has a favorable safety profile. We studied the efficacy of salsalate in reducing glycemia and insulin resistance and potential mechanisms of action to validate NF-kappaB as a potential pharmacologic target in diabetes. METHODS AND RESULTS: In open label studies, both high (4.5 g/d) and standard (3.0 g/d) doses of salsalate reduced fasting and postchallenge glucose levels after 2 weeks of treatment. Salsalate increased glucose utilization during euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamps, by approximately 50\% and 15\% at the high and standard doses, respectively, and insulin clearance was decreased. Dose-limiting tinnitus occurred only at the higher dose. In a third, double-masked, placebo-controlled trial, 1 month of salsalate at maximum tolerable dose (no tinnitus) improved fasting and postchallenge glucose levels. Circulating free fatty acids were reduced and adiponectin increased in all treated subjects. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that salsalate improves in vivo glucose and lipid homeostasis, and support targeting of inflammation and NF-kappaB as a therapeutic approach in type 2 diabetes.

  abstract = {Neuroanatomical differences attributable to aging and gender have been well documented, and these differences may be associated with differences in behaviors and cognitive performance. However, little is known about the dynamic organization of anatomical connectivity within the cerebral cortex, which may underlie population differences in brain function. In this study, we investigated age and sex effects on the anatomical connectivity patterns of 95 normal subjects ranging in age from 19 to 85 years. Using the connectivity probability derived from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging tractography, we characterized the cerebral cortex as a weighted network of connected regions. This approach captures the underlying organization of anatomical connectivity for each subject at a regional level. Advanced graph theoretical analysis revealed that the resulting cortical networks exhibited ``small-world'' character (i.e., efficient information transfer both at local and global scale). In particular, the precuneus and posterior cingulate gyrus were consistently observed as centrally connected regions, independent of age and sex. Additional analysis revealed a reduction in overall cortical connectivity with age. There were also changes in the underlying network organization that resulted in decreased local efficiency, and also a shift of regional efficiency from the parietal and occipital to frontal and temporal neocortex in older brains. In addition, women showed greater overall cortical connectivity and the underlying organization of their cortical networks was more efficient, both locally and globally. There were also distributed regional differences in efficiency between sexes. Our results provide new insights into the substrates that underlie behavioral and cognitive differences in aging and sex.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to study the hypothalamic volume in a cohort of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) including symptomatic and presymptomatic ALS mutation carriers. METHODS: High-resolution three-dimensional T1-weighted MRI datasets from 251 patients with sporadic ALS, 19 symptomatic and 32 presymptomatic ALS mutation carriers and 112 healthy controls (HC) were retrospectivally registered for manual delineation of the hypothalamus. The volume of the hypothalamus, in total or subdivided, was normalised to the intracranial volume and adjusted to age. Correlation analyses were performed with clinical and metabolic outcomes. Pathologically defined ALS stages were determined in vivo by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). RESULTS: We observed a severe atrophy of the hypothalamus both in patients with sporadic ALS (-21.8\%, p{$<$}0.0001) and symptomatic ALS mutation carriers (-13.4\%, p{$<$}0.001). The atrophy in patients with sporadic ALS was observed in both the anterior (-27.6\% p{$<$}0.0001) and the posterior parts of the hypothalamus (-17.7\%, p{$<$}0.0001). Notably, this atrophy was also observed in presymptomatic ALS mutation carriers (-15.5\%, p{$<$}0.001) and was unrelated to whole brain volume atrophy or disease stage as assessed using DTI or functional status. Hypothalamic volume was correlated with body mass index (BMI) in patients with sporadic ALS (p=0.0434, rho=+0.1579), and this correlation was much stronger in patients with familial ALS (fALS) (p=0.0060, rho=+0.6053). Anterior hypothalamic volume was correlated with age at onset, but not with survival after MRI. CONCLUSIONS: Hypothalamus is atrophied in ALS, even in premorbid stages, and correlates with BMI, especially in fALS. Decreased anterior hypothalamic volume is associated with earlier onset of disease.},

Several sophisticated software packages (e.g., AFNI, BrainVoyager, FSL, FreeSurfer, Nipy, R, SPM) are used to process and analyze large and often diverse (highly multi-dimensional) data. However, this heterogeneous collection of specialized applications creates several issues that hinder replicable, efficient, and optimal use of neuroimaging analysis approaches: (1) No uniform access to neuroimaging analysis software and usage information; (2) No framework for comparative algorithm development and dissemination; (3) Personnel turnover in laboratories often limits methodological continuity and training new personnel takes time; (4) Neuroimaging software packages do not address computational efficiency; and (5) Methods sections in journal articles are inadequate for reproducing results. To address these issues, we present Nipype (Neuroimaging in Python: Pipelines and Interfaces; http://nipy.org/nipype), an open-source, community-developed, software package, and scriptable library. Nipype solves the issues by providing Interfaces to existing neuroimaging software with uniform usage semantics and by facilitating interaction between these packages using Workflows. Nipype provides an environment that encourages interactive exploration of algorithms, eases the design of Workflows within and between packages, allows rapid comparative development of algorithms and reduces the learning curve necessary to use different packages. Nipype supports both local and remote execution on multi-core machines and clusters, without additional scripting. Nipype is Berkeley Software Distribution licensed, allowing anyone unrestricted usage. An open, community-driven development philosophy allows the software to quickly adapt and address the varied needs of the evolving neuroimaging community, especially in the context of increasing demand for reproducible research.},

Whether these risk factors directly contribute to brain amyloid deposition is less well understood.Objective~ To determine if midlife vascular risk factors are associated with late-life brain amyloid deposition, measured using florbetapir positron emission tomography (PET).Design, Setting, and Participants~ The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC){\textendash}PET Amyloid Imaging Study, a prospective cohort study among 346 participants without dementia in 3 US communities (Washington County, Maryland; Forsyth County, North Carolina; and Jackson, Mississippi) who have been evaluated for vascular risk factors and markers since 1987-1989 with florbetapir PET scans in 2011-2013. Positron emission tomography image analysis was completed in 2015.Exposures~ Vascular risk factors at ARIC baseline (age 45-64 years; risk factors included body mass index {$\geq$}30, current smoking, hypertension, diabetes, and total cholesterol {$\geq$}200 mg/dL) were evaluated in multivariable models including age, sex, race, APOE genotype, and educational level.Main Outcomes and Measures~ Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated from PET scans and a mean global cortical SUVR was calculated. Elevated florbetapir (defined as a SUVR \&gt;1.2) was the dependent variable.Results~ Among 322 participants without dementia and with nonmissing midlife vascular risk factors at baseline (mean age, 52 years; 58\% female; 43\% black), the SUVR (elevated in 164 [50.9\%] participants) was measured more than 20 years later (median follow-up, 23.5 years; interquartile range, 23.0-24.3 years) when participants were between 67 and 88 (mean, 76) years old. Elevated body mass index in midlife was associated with elevated SUVR (odds ratio [OR], 2.06; 95\% CI, 1.16-3.65). At baseline, 65 participants had no vascular risk factors, 123 had 1, and 134 had 2 or more; a higher number of midlife risk factors was associated with elevated amyloid SUVR at follow-up (30.8\% [n\,=\,20], 50.4\% [n\,=\,62], and 61.2\% [n\,=\,82], respectively). In adjusted models, compared with 0 midlife vascular risk factors, the OR for elevated SUVR associated with 1 vascular risk factor was 1.88 (95\% CI, 0.95-3.72) and for 2 or more vascular risk factors was 2.88 (95\% CI, 1.46-5.69). No significant race {\texttimes} risk factor interactions were found. Late-life vascular risk factors were not associated with late-life brain amyloid deposition (for {$\geq$}2 late-life vascular risk factors vs 0: OR, 1.66; 95\% CI, 0.75-3.69).Conclusions and Relevance~ An increasing number of midlife vascular risk factors was significantly associated with elevated amyloid SUVR; this association was not significant for late-life risk factors. These findings are consistent with a role of vascular disease in the development of Alzheimer disease.}

  abstract = {The main challenge in the field of neurocognitive ageing is to understand the brain mechanisms that might underlie age differences in cognitive performance or why some functions are maintained into older age.A number of ideas have been suggested to explain age differences in brain activity during cognitive tasks, including compensation, dedifferentiation and less efficient use of neural resources. Although there is evidence to support all of these theories, there is also evidence to the contrary, and it is not yet clear whether one is more characteristic of ageing than the others.Recently, there has been increasing interest in examining the effects of age on large-scale brain networks. One of these in particular, the default network, appears to be especially vulnerable to the effects of age.There is evidence that age differences in brain structure can influence the relationship between activity in task-related brain regions and behaviour, indicating a complex interplay between structure and function.There is a growing literature on how various risk factors for Alzheimer's disease, such as the apolipoprotein Egene and mild cognitive impairment, affect task-related brain activity in older adults. This work also highlights the similarities between age differences in healthy older versus younger adults and differences between adults with mild cognitive impairment and controls, suggesting a continuum of effects due to age and neuropathological brain changes.Future work should aim to more clearly define compensatory brain activity, make more use of lifespan and longitudinal approaches and attempt to account for the large number of factors that influence the ageing process, which vary from individual to individual and include genetics and life experiences.}

The objectives of this study were to investigate the topographic patterns of white matter hyperintensities associated with Alzheimer's disease biomarkers measured using PET. From the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, 434 participants without dementia (55\% male) with FLAIR and gradient recall echo MRI, tau-PET (AV-1451) and amyloid-PET scans were identified. A subset had cerebral microbleeds detected on T2* gradient recall echo scans. White matter hyperintensities were semi-automatically segmented using FLAIR MRI in participant space and normalized to a custom template. We used statistical parametric mapping 12-based, voxel-wise, multiple-regression analyses to detect white matter hyperintense regions associated with Alzheimer's biomarkers (global amyloid from amyloid-PET and meta-regions of interest tau uptake from tau-PET) after adjusting for age, sex and hypertension. For amyloid associations, we additionally adjusted for tau and vice versa. Topographic patterns of amyloid-associated white matter hyperintensities included periventricular white matter hyperintensities (frontal and parietal lobes). White matter hyperintense volumes in the detected topographic pattern correlated strongly with lobar cerebral microbleeds (P \&lt; 0.001, age and sex adjusted Cohen's d = 0.703). In contrast, there were no white matter hyperintense regions significantly associated with increased tau burden using voxel-based analysis or region-specific analysis. Among non-demented elderly, amyloid load correlated with a topographic pattern of white matter hyperintensities. Further, the amyloid-associated, white matter hyperintense regions strongly correlated with lobar cerebral microbleeds suggesting that cerebral amyloid angiopathy contributes to the relationship between amyloid and white matter hyperintensities. The study did not support an association between increased tau burden and white matter hyperintense burden.}

There has been substantial progress in the understanding of CMBs in recent years, particularly in the development of newer MRI methods for the detection of CMBs and the application of these techniques to population-based samples of elderly people. In this Review, we focus on these recent developments and their effects on two main questions: how CMBs are detected, and how CMBs should be interpreted. The number of CMBs detected depends on MRI characteristics, such as pulse sequence, sequence parameters, spatial resolution, magnetic field strength, and image post-processing, emphasising the importance of taking into account MRI technique in the interpretation of study results. Recent investigations with sensitive MRI techniques have indicated a high prevalence of CMBs in community-dwelling elderly people. We propose a procedural guide for identification of CMBs and suggest possible future approaches for elucidating the role of these common lesions as markers for, and contributors to, small-vessel brain disease.}

  abstract = {Background White matter hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin (WMH) are frequent in cerebral magnetic resonance imaging of older people. They are promoted by vascular risk factors, especially hypertension, and are associated with cognitive deficits at the group level. It has been suggested that not only the severity, but also the location, of lesions might critically influence cognitive deficits and represent different pathologies. Methods In 560 participants (65.2 {$\pm$} 7.5 years, 51.4\% males) of the population-based 1000BRAINS study, we analyzed the association of regional WMH using Fazekas scoring separately for cerebral lobes, with hypertension and cognition. Results WMH most often affected the frontal lobe (83.7\% score {$>$}0), followed by the parietal (75.8\%), temporal (32.7\%), and occipital lobe (7.3\%). Higher Fazekas scores in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe were associated with higher blood pressure and antihypertensive treatment in unadjusted ordinal regression models and in models adjusted for age, sex, and vascular risk factors (e.g., age- and sex-adjusted odds ratio = 1.14, 95\% confidence interval = 1.03{\textendash}1.25 for the association of frontal lobe WMH Fazekas score with systolic blood pressure [SBP] [per 10 mm Hg]; 1.13 [1.02{\textendash}1.23] for the association of parietal lobe score with SBP; 1.72 [1.19{\textendash}2.48] for the association of temporal lobe score with antihypertensive medications). In linear regressions, higher frontal lobe scores were associated with lower performance in executive function and non-verbal memory, and higher parietal lobe scores were associated with lower performance in executive function, verbal-, and non-verbal memory. Conclusions Hypertension promotes WMH in the frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe. WMH in the frontal and parietal lobe are associated with reduced executive function and memory.},

  abstract = {Objective This investigation aimed at examining whether circulating inflammatory biomarkers C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL6), and alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) were related to cerebrovascular disease (CVD) assessed by MRI.Methods The study included nondemented elderly participants of a community-based, multiethnic cohort, who received baseline MRI scans and had CRP (n = 508), ACT (435), and IL6 (N = 357) measured by ELISA. Silent brain infarcts and white matter hyperintensities (WMH) were derived from all available MRI scans at baseline, approximately 4.4 years after blood sample collection for inflammatory biomarkers. Repeated assessments of infarcts and WMH, as well as microbleeds assessment, were performed at follow-up MRI visits around 4.5 years later. Cross-sectional and longitudinal relationship between inflammatory biomarkers and CVD were analyzed using appropriate logistic regression models, generalized linear models, or COX models.Results After adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, education, APOE genotype, and intracranial volume, 1 SD increase in log10IL6 was associated with infarcts on MRI \{odds ratio [OR] (95\% confidence interval [CI]) = 1.28 [1.02{\textendash}1.60], p = 0.033\}, and 1 SD increase in log10CRP and log10ACT was associated with microbleeds (OR [95\% CI] = 1.46 [1.02{\textendash}2.09], p = 0.041; and 1.65 [1.11{\textendash}2.46], p = 0.013; respectively). One SD increase in log10ACT was also associated with larger WMH at the follow-up MRI (b = 0.103, p = 0.012) and increased accumulation of WMH volume (b = 0.062, p = 0.041) during follow-up. The associations remained significant after additional adjustment of vascular risk factors and excluding participants with clinical stroke.Conclusions Among older adults, increased circulating inflammatory biomarkers were associated with the presence of infarcts and microbleeds, WMH burden, and progression of WMH.ACT=alpha 1-antichymotrypsin; APOE=apolipoprotein; BMI=body mass index; CAA=cerebral amyloid angiopathy; CVD=cerebrovascular disease; CRP=C-reactive protein; CV=coefficient of variation; FOV=field of view; GRE=gradient echo; ICV=intracranial volume; IL6=interleukin-6; WHICAP=Washington Heights/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project; WMH=white matter hyperintensity; sICAM-1=intercellular adhesion molecule-1}

Far from being limited to weight gain, obesity is generally associated with low-grade inflammation and with a cluster of disorders collectively known as the `metabolic syndrome'. When considering obesity and the subsequent neuroinflammation, the focus was long set on the hypothalamus. More recently, obesity-derived neuroinflammation has been shown to affect other brain structures such as the hippocampus, cortex, brainstem, or amygdala. Furthermore, obesity has been associated with increased occurrence of central disorders such as depression and impaired cognitive function. We discuss here the effects and mechanisms of obesity-derived neuroinflammation, with a specific emphasis on extra-hypothalamic structures, as well as the repercussions of neuroinflammation for some cerebral functions.},

Dietary information was collected via a food frequency questionnaire. Total brain volume (TBV), total gray matter volume (TGMV), total white matter volume (TWMV), mean cortical thickness (mCT), and regional volume or CT were derived from MRI scans using FreeSurfer program. We examined the association of MeDi (scored as 0{\textendash}9) and individual food groups with brain volume and thickness using regression models adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, education, body mass index, diabetes, and cognition.Results: Compared to lower MeDi adherence (0{\textendash}4), higher adherence (5{\textendash}9) was associated with 13.11 (p = 0.007), 5.00 (p = 0.05), and 6.41 (p = 0.05) milliliter larger TBV, TGMV, and TWMV, respectively. Higher fish (b = 7.06, p = 0.006) and lower meat (b = 8.42, p = 0.002) intakes were associated with larger TGMV. Lower meat intake was also associated with larger TBV (b = 12.20, p = 0.02). Higher fish intake was associated with 0.019 mm (p = 0.03) larger mCT. Volumes of cingulate cortex, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and hippocampus and CT of the superior-frontal region were associated with the dietary factors.Conclusions: Among older adults, MeDi adherence was associated with less brain atrophy, with an effect similar to 5 years of aging. Higher fish and lower meat intake might be the 2 key food elements that contribute to the benefits of MeDi on brain structure.AD=Alzheimer disease; AGE=advanced glycation end products; BMI=body mass index; CDR=Clinical Dementia Rating; DSM-III-R=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3rd edition, revised; FFQ=food frequency questionnaire; GLM=generalized linear model; GM=gray matter; ICV=intracranial volume; MANOVA=multivariate analysis of variance; MCI=mild cognitive impairment; mCT=mean cortical thickness; MeDi=Mediterranean diet; PUFA=polyunsaturated fatty acids; ROI=region of interest; SFA=saturated fats; TBV=total brain volume; TGMV=total gray matter volume; TWMV=total white matter volume; WHICAP=Washington Heights/Hamilton Heights Inwood Columbia Aging Project; WM=white matter}

  abstract = {See Schmahmann (doi: 10.1093/brain/aww064 ) for a scientific commentary on this article. Neurodegenerative diseases are associated with distinct and distributed patterns of atrophy in the cerebral cortex. Emerging evidence suggests that these atrophy patterns resemble intrinsic connectivity networks in the healthy brain, supporting the network-based degeneration framework where neuropathology spreads across connectivity networks. An intriguing yet untested possibility is that the cerebellar circuits, which share extensive connections with the cerebral cortex, could be selectively targeted by major neurodegenerative diseases. Here we examined the structural atrophy in the cerebellum across common types of neurodegenerative diseases, and characterized the functional connectivity patterns of these cerebellar atrophy regions. Our results showed that Alzheimer's disease and frontotemporal dementia are associated with distinct and circumscribed atrophy in the cerebellum. These cerebellar atrophied regions share robust and selective intrinsic connectivity with the atrophied regions in the cerebral cortex. These findings for the first time demonstrated the selective vulnerability of the cerebellum to common neurodegenerative disease, extending the network-based degeneration framework to the cerebellum. Our work also has direct implications on the cerebellar contribution to the cognitive and affective processes that are compromised in neurodegeneration as well as the practice of using the cerebellum as reference region for ligand neuroimaging studies.}

  abstract = {Background Alterations in the hedonic component of ingestive behaviors have been implicated as a possible risk factor in the pathophysiology of overweight and obese individuals. Neuroimaging evidence from individuals with increasing body mass index suggests structural, functional, and neurochemical alterations in the extended reward network and associated networks. Aim To apply a multivariate pattern analysis to distinguish normal weight and overweight subjects based on gray and white-matter measurements. Methods Structural images (N~=~120, overweight N~=~63) and diffusion tensor images (DTI) (N~=~60, overweight N~=~30) were obtained from healthy control subjects. For the total sample the mean age for the overweight group (females~=~32, males~=~31) was 28.77~years (SD~=~9.76) and for the normal weight group (females~=~32, males~=~25) was 27.13~years (SD~=~9.62). Regional segmentation and parcellation of the brain images was performed using Freesurfer. Deterministic tractography was performed to measure the normalized fiber density between regions. A multivariate pattern analysis approach was used to examine whether brain measures can distinguish overweight from normal weight individuals. Results 1. White-matter classification: The classification algorithm, based on 2 signatures with 17 regional connections, achieved 97\% accuracy in discriminating overweight individuals from normal weight individuals. For both brain signatures, greater connectivity as indexed by increased fiber density was observed in overweight compared to normal weight between the reward network regions and regions of the executive control, emotional arousal, and somatosensory networks. In contrast, the opposite pattern (decreased fiber density) was found between ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the anterior insula, and between thalamus and executive control network regions. 2. Gray-matter classification: The classification algorithm, based on 2 signatures with 42 morphological features, achieved 69\% accuracy in discriminating overweight from normal weight. In both brain signatures regions of the reward, salience, executive control and emotional arousal networks were associated with lower morphological values in overweight individuals compared to normal weight individuals, while the opposite pattern was seen for regions of the somatosensory network. Conclusions 1. An increased BMI (i.e., overweight subjects) is associated with distinct changes in gray-matter and fiber density of the brain. 2. Classification algorithms based on white-matter connectivity involving regions of the reward and associated networks can identify specific targets for mechanistic studies and future drug development aimed at abnormal ingestive behavior and in overweight/obesity.},

Methods Forty-two nondemented CAA patients, 50 HE subjects, and 43 AD/MCI patients had brain MRI and PiB PET. Multivariate linear regression was used to assess the independent association between PiB retention and white matter disease volume, controlling for age, gender, apolipoprotein E genotype, and vascular risk factors within each group. Results CAA patients were younger than HE and AD subjects (68 {$\pm$} 10 vs 73.3 {$\pm$} 7 and 74 {$\pm$} 7.4, p {$<$} 0.01) but had higher amounts of WMH (median = 21 vs 3.2 and 10.8 ml, respectively, p {$<$} 0.05 for both comparisons). Global PiB retention and WMH showed strong correlation (rho = 0.52, p {$<$} 0.001) in the CAA group but not in HE or AD. These associations did not change in the multivariate models. Lobar microbleed count, another marker of CAA severity, also remained as an independent predictor of WMH volume. Interpretation Our results indicate that amyloid burden in CAA subjects (with primarily vascular amyloid) but not AD subjects (with primarily parenchymal amyloid) independently correlates with WMH volume. These findings support the idea that vascular amyloid burden directly contributes to chronic cerebral ischemia and highlights the possible utility of amyloid imaging as a marker of CAA severity.

  abstract = {Background~ Overweight and obesity are epidemic in Western societies and constitute a major public health problem because of adverse effects on vascular health. Vascular factors may play a role in the development of a rapidly growing disease of late life, Alzheimer disease (AD). Using body mass index (BMI, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters), we examined whether overweight is a risk factor for dementia and AD.Methods~ The relationship between BMI and dementia risk was investigated in a representative cohort of 392 nondemented Swedish adults who were followed up from age 70 to 88 years, with the use of neuropsychiatric, anthropometric, and other measurements. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analyses included BMI, blood pressure, cardiovascular disease, cigarette smoking, socioeconomic status, and treatment for hypertension.Results:~ During the 18-year follow-up (4184.8 risk-years), 93 participants were diagnosed as having dementia. Women who developed dementia between ages 79 and 88 years were overweight, with a higher average BMI at age 70 years (27.7 vs 25.7; P = .007), 75 years (27.9 vs 25.0; P\&lt;.001), and 79 years (26.9 vs 25.1; P = .02) compared with nondemented women. A higher degree of overweight was observed in women who developed AD at 70 years (29.3; P = .009), 75 years (29.6; P\&lt;.001), and 79 years (28.2; P = .003) compared with nondemented women. For every 1.0 increase in BMI at age 70 years, AD risk increased by 36\%. These associations were not found in men.Conclusions~ Overweight is epidemic in Western societies. Our data suggest that overweight at high ages is a risk factor for dementia, particularly AD, in women. This may have profound implications for dementia prevention.}

METHODS: A representative sample of 290 women born in 1908, 1914, 1918, and 1922 was examined in 1968 to 1969, 1974 to 1975, 1980 to 1981, and 1992 to 1993 as part of the Population Study of Women in Goteborg, Sweden. At each examination, women completed a survey on a variety of health and lifestyle factors and underwent anthropometric, clinical, and neuropsychiatric assessments and blood collection. Atrophy of the temporal, frontal, occipital, and parietal lobes was measured on CT in 1992 when participants were age 70 to 84. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to assess the relationship between BMI and brain measures. RESULTS: Women with atrophy of the temporal lobe were, on average, 1.1 to 1.5 kg/m2 higher in BMI at all examinations than women without temporal atrophy (p {$<$} 0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that age and BMI were the only significant predictors of temporal atrophy. Risk of temporal atrophy increased 13 to 16\% per 1.0-kg/m2 increase in BMI (p {$<$} 0.05). There were no associations between BMI and atrophy measured at three other brain locations. CONCLUSION: Overweight and obesity throughout adult life may contribute to the development of temporal atrophy in women.},

Hypothalamic volumes were measured by a segmentation method combining manual and automated steps. Overall, obese participants had descriptively smaller hypothalamic volumes, although this difference did not reach statistical significance; however, among obese participants, females had significantly smaller hypothalamic volumes than their male counterparts. There was a significant interaction between insulin resistance and sex on hypothalamus volume; obese females with significant insulin resistance have smaller hypothalamic volumes than obese males. Obese adolescents had higher circulating CRP and neurotrophin levels. Furthermore, among obese females, BDNF concentrations were inversely associated with hypothalamus volumes (r = -0.48). Given this negative association between BDNF and hypothalamus volumes among obese insulin-resistant females, elevated neurotrophin levels may suggest an attempt at protective compensation.}

Moreover, quantitative MRI approaches offer the advantage of absolute rather than relative characterization of the underlying biochemical composition of the tissue, allowing more reliable comparison within subjects and between healthy subjects and patients. Finally, we explored two parcellation methods (thresholding the MR parameter values vs. surface gradients of these values) to determine areal borders based on the cortical surface pattern.

  abstract = {Introduction We sought to investigate associations of regional white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) within white matter (WM) tracts with cardiovascular risk and brain aging-related atrophy throughout adulthood in the general population, leveraging state of the art pattern analysis methods. Methods We analyzed a large sample (n~=~2367) from the Study of Health in Pomerania, Germany (range 20{\textendash}90~years). WMHs were automatically segmented on T1-weighted and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery magnetic resonance images, and WMH volumes were calculated in WM regions defined using the John Hopkins University WM tractography atlas. Regions with the highest average WMH volume were selected. We calculated a subject-specific index, Spatial Pattern of Alteration for Recognition of Brain Aging, to measure age-related atrophy patterns. The Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score summarized the individual cardiovascular risk profile. We used structural equation models, independently for each region, using Spatial Pattern of Alteration for Recognition of Brain Aging as a dependent variable, age as an independent variable, and cardiovascular disease risk score and regional WMH volumes as mediators. Results Selected 12 WM regions included 75\% of the total WMH burden in average. Structural equation models showed that the age effect on Spatial Pattern of Alteration for Recognition of Brain Aging was mediated by WMHs to a different extent in the superior frontal WM, anterior corona radiata, inferior frontal WM, superior corona radiata, superior longitudinal fasciculus, middle temporal WM, posterior corona radiata, superior parietal WM, splenium of corpus callosum, posterior thalamic radiation, and middle occipital WM (variance explained between 2.8\% and 10.3\%, P~{$<~$}.0001 Bonferroni corrected), but not in precentral WM. Conclusions Our results indicate that WMHs, in most WM tracts, might accelerate the brain aging process throughout adulthood in the general population as a result of vascular risk factors, but also independent of them. Preventive strategies against WMHs (such as controlling vascular risk factors or microglia depletion) could delay brain aging.},

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities are associated with increased risk of dementia and cognitive decline. The current study investigates the relationship between white matter hyperintensities burden and patterns of brain atrophy associated with brain ageing and Alzheimer's disease in a large populatison-based sample ( n = 2367) encompassing a wide age range (20{\textendash}90 years), from the Study of Health in Pomerania. We quantified white matter hyperintensities using automated segmentation and summarized atrophy patterns using machine learning methods resulting in two indices: the SPARE-BA index (capturing age-related brain atrophy), and the SPARE-AD index (previously developed to capture patterns of atrophy found in patients with Alzheimer's disease). A characteristic pattern of age-related accumulation of white matter hyperintensities in both periventricular and deep white matter areas was found. Individuals with high white matter hyperintensities burden showed significantly ( P \&lt; 0.0001) lower SPARE-BA and higher SPARE-AD values compared to those with low white matter hyperintensities burden, indicating that the former had more patterns of atrophy in brain regions typically affected by ageing and Alzheimer's disease dementia. To investigate a possibly causal role of white matter hyperintensities, structural equation modelling was used to quantify the effect of Framingham cardiovascular disease risk score and white matter hyperintensities burden on SPARE-BA, revealing a statistically significant ( P \&lt; 0.0001) causal relationship between them. Structural equation modelling showed that the age effect on SPARE-BA was mediated by white matter hyperintensities and cardiovascular risk score each explaining 10.4\% and 21.6\% of the variance, respectively. The direct age effect explained 70.2\% of the SPARE-BA variance. Only white matter hyperintensities significantly mediated the age effect on SPARE-AD explaining 32.8\% of the variance. The direct age effect explained 66.0\% of the SPARE-AD variance. Multivariable regression showed significant relationship between white matter hyperintensities volume and hypertension ( P = 0.001), diabetes mellitus ( P = 0.023), smoking ( P = 0.002) and education level ( P = 0.003). The only significant association with cognitive tests was with the immediate recall of the California verbal and learning memory test. No significant association was present with the APOE genotype. These results support the hypothesis that white matter hyperintensities contribute to patterns of brain atrophy found in beyond-normal brain ageing in the general population. White matter hyperintensities also contribute to brain atrophy patterns in regions related to Alzheimer's disease dementia, in agreement with their known additive role to the likelihood of dementia. Preventive strategies reducing the odds to develop cardiovascular disease and white matter hyperintensities could decrease the incidence or delay the onset of dementia.}

  abstract = {The incidence of stroke and dementia are diverging across the world, rising for those in low- and middle-income countries and falling in those in high-income countries. This suggests that whatever factors cause these trends are potentially modifiable. At the population level, neurological disorders as a group account for the largest proportion of disability-adjusted life years globally (10\%). Among neurological disorders, stroke (42\%) and dementia (10\%) dominate. Stroke and dementia confer risks for each other and share some of the same, largely modifiable, risk and protective factors. In principle, 90\% of strokes and 35\% of dementias have been estimated to be preventable. Because a stroke doubles the chance of developing dementia and stroke is more common than dementia, more than a third of dementias could be prevented by preventing stroke. Developments at the pathological, pathophysiological, and clinical level also point to new directions. Growing understanding of brain pathophysiology has unveiled the reciprocal interaction of cerebrovascular disease and neurodegeneration identifying new therapeutic targets to include protection of the endothelium, the blood-brain barrier, and other components of the neurovascular unit. In addition, targeting amyloid angiopathy aspects of inflammation and genetic manipulation hold new testable promise. In the meantime, accumulating evidence suggests that whole populations experiencing improved education, and lower vascular risk factor profiles (e.g., reduced prevalence of smoking) and vascular disease, including stroke, have better cognitive function and lower dementia rates. At the individual levels, trials have demonstrated that anticoagulation of atrial fibrillation can reduce the risk of dementia by 48\% and that systolic blood pressure lower than 140~mmHg may be better for the brain. Based on these considerations, the World Stroke Organization has issued a proclamation, endorsed by all the major international organizations focused on global brain and cardiovascular health, calling for the joint prevention of stroke and dementia. This article summarizes the evidence for translation into action.},

  abstract = {Although in the last decade brain activation in healthy aging and dementia was mainly studied using task-activation fMRI, there is increasing interest in task-induced decreases in brain activity, termed deactivations. These deactivations occur in the so-called default mode network (DMN). In parallel a growing number of studies focused on spontaneous, ongoing 'baseline' activity in the DMN. These resting state fMRI studies explored the functional connectivity in the DMN. Here we review whether normal aging and dementia affect task-induced deactivation and functional connectivity in the DMN. The majority of studies show a decreased DMN functional connectivity and task-induced DMN deactivations along a continuum from normal aging to mild cognitive impairment and to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Even subjects at risk for developing AD, either in terms of having amyloid plaques or carrying the APOE4 allele, showed disruptions in the DMN. While fMRI is a useful tool for detecting changes in DMN functional connectivity and deactivation, more work needs to be conducted to conclude whether these measures will become useful as a clinical diagnostic tool in AD.

Understanding brain networks in aging is essential, as brain function depends on large-scale distributed networks. Little is known of structural covariance networks to study inter-regional gray matter anatomical associations in aging. Here, we investigate anatomical brain networks based on structural covariance of gray matter volume among 370 middle-aged to older adults of 45?85~years. For each of 370 subjects, we acquired a T1-weighted anatomical MRI scan. After segmentation of structural MRI scans, nine anatomical networks were defined based on structural covariance of gray matter volume among subjects. We analyzed associations between age and gray matter volume in anatomical networks using linear regression analyses. Age was negatively associated with gray matter volume in four anatomical networks (P~{$<~$}0.001, corrected): a subcortical network, sensorimotor network, posterior cingulate network, and an anterior cingulate network. Age was not significantly associated with gray matter volume in five networks: temporal network, auditory network, and three cerebellar networks. These results were independent of gender and white matter hyperintensities. Gray matter volume decreases with age in networks containing subcortical structures, sensorimotor structures, posterior, and anterior cingulate cortices. Gray matter volume in temporal, auditory, and cerebellar networks remains relatively unaffected with advancing age.},

We examined vascular risk factors with respect to a cerebrovascular measure of brain functioning in subjects in mid-life, which could represent a marker of brain changes in later life. Breath-hold functional MRI (fMRI) was performed in 541 women and men (mean age 50.4years) from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Brain MRI sub-study. Cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) was quantified as percentage change in blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in activated voxels, which was mapped to a common brain template and log-transformed. Mean CVR was calculated for anatomic regions underlying the default-mode network (DMN) {\textendash} a network implicated in AD and other brain disorders {\textendash} in addition to areas considered to be relatively spared in the disease (e.g. occipital lobe), which were utilized as reference regions. Mean CVR was significantly reduced in the posterior cingulate/precuneus ({$\beta$}=-0.063, 95\% CI: -0.106, -0.020), anterior cingulate ({$\beta$}=-0.055, 95\% CI: -0.101, -0.010), and medial frontal lobe ({$\beta$}=-0.050, 95\% CI: -0.092, -0.008) relative to mean CVR in the occipital lobe, after adjustment for age, sex, race, education, and smoking status, in subjects with pre-hypertension/hypertension compared to normotensive subjects. By contrast, mean CVR was lower, but not significantly, in the inferior parietal lobe ({$\beta$}=-0.024, 95\% CI: -0.062, 0.014) and the hippocampus ({$\beta$}=-0.006, 95\% CI: -0.062, 0.050) relative to mean CVR in the occipital lobe. Similar results were observed in subjects with diabetes and dyslipidemia compared to those without these conditions, though the differences were non-significant. Reduced CVR may represent diminished vascular functionality for the DMN for individuals with prehypertension/hypertension in mid-life, and may serve as a preclinical marker for brain dysfunction in later life.},

  abstract = {Slowed processing speed is considered a hallmark feature of cognitive decline in cerebral small vessel disease (SVD); however, it is unclear whether SVD's association with slowed processing might be due to its association with overall declining general cognitive ability. We quantified the total MRI-visible SVD burden of 540 members of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (age: 72.6\,{$\pm$}\,0.7 years; 47\% female). Using latent growth curve modelling, we tested associations between total SVD burden at mean age 73 and changes in general cognitive ability, processing speed, verbal memory and visuospatial ability, measured at age 73, 76, 79 and 82. Covariates included age, sex, vascular risk and childhood cognitive ability. In the fully adjusted models, greater SVD burden was associated with greater declines in general cognitive ability (standardised {$\beta$}: -0.201; 95\% CI: [-0.36, -0.04]; pFDR\,=\,0.022) and processing speed (-0.222; [-0.40, -0.04]; pFDR\,=\,0.022). SVD burden accounted for between 4 and 5\% of variance in declines of general cognitive ability and processing speed. After accounting for the covariance between tests of processing speed and general cognitive ability, only SVD's association with greater decline in general cognitive ability remained significant, prior to FDR correction (-0.222; [-0.39, -0.06]; p\,=\,0.008; pFDR\,=\,0.085). Our findings do not support the notion that SVD has a specific association with declining processing speed, independent of decline in general cognitive ability (which captures the variance shared across domains of cognitive ability). The association between SVD burden and declining general cognitive ability supports the notion of SVD as a diffuse, whole-brain disease and suggests that trials monitoring SVD-related cognitive changes should consider domain-specific changes in the context of overall, general cognitive decline.},

We report on the prevalence of lacunes, white matter hyperintensity (WMH), and cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) in a community-based sample in China and compare the results with those of other studies. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional analysis of the population-based Shunyi Study in China. A total of 1,211 stroke-free participants (mean age, 55.6{$\pm$}9.3 years; 37.4\% men) with available 3 Tesla (3T) magnetic resonance images were included in this analysis. Demographic information and risk factor data were assessed. The overall and age-specific prevalence of lacunes, WMH, and CMBs was evaluated. Associations between cardiovascular risk factors and the presence of these lesions were analyzed by multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: Our study showed a prevalence of 14.5\% for lacunes, 72.1\% for periventricular hyperintensity (PVH), 65.4\% for deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH), and 10.6\% for CMBs. When compared with other community-based samples, individuals in the same age group showed a higher burden of lacunes and a relatively lower prevalence of CMBs. Advanced age was independently associated with the prevalence of these CSVD markers, while the presence of hypertension increased the risk of lacunes, PVH/DWMH, and CMBs in deep or infratentorial locations. CONCLUSIONS: A higher burden of lacunes but a relatively lower prevalence of CMBs was observed in this Chinese population. This notable result highlights the challenge of CSVD prevention in China. Chinese have a risk factor profile for CSVD similar to those in other populations.},

We investigated how the reliability of cortical thickness measurements is affected by MRI instrument-related factors, including scanner field strength, manufacturer, upgrade and pulse sequence. Several data processing factors were also studied. Two test{\textendash}retest data sets were analyzed: 1) 15 healthy older subjects scanned four times at 2-week intervals on three scanners; 2) 5 subjects scanned before and after a major scanner upgrade. Within-scanner variability of global cortical thickness measurements was {$<$}0.03~mm, and the point-wise standard deviation of measurement error was approximately 0.12~mm. Variability was 0.15~mm and 0.17~mm in average, respectively, for cross-scanner (Siemens/GE) and cross-field strength (1.5~T/3~T) comparisons. Scanner upgrade did not increase variability nor introduce bias. Measurements across field strength, however, were slightly biased (thicker at 3~T). The number of (single vs. multiple averaged) acquisitions had a negligible effect on reliability, but the use of a different pulse sequence had a larger impact, as did different parameters employed in data processing. Sample size estimates indicate that regional cortical thickness difference of 0.2~mm between two different groups could be identified with as few as 7 subjects per group, and a difference of 0.1~mm could be detected with 26 subjects per group. These results demonstrate that MRI-derived cortical thickness measures are highly reliable when MRI instrument and data processing factors are controlled but that it is important to consider these factors in the design of multi-site or longitudinal studies, such as clinical drug trials.},

The ability to use context{\textemdash}including interoceptive satiety states{\textemdash}to inhibit responding to previously rewarded cues appears to depend on the functional integrity of the hippocampus. Recent evidence implicates energy dense Western diets in several types of hippocampal dysfunction, including reduced expression of neurotrophins and nutrient transporters, increased inflammation, microglial activation, and blood brain barrier permeability. The functional consequences of such insults include impairments in an animal's ability to modulate responding to previously reinforced cues. We propose that such deficits promote overeating, which can further exacerbate hippocampal dysfunction and thus initiate a vicious cycle of both obesity and progressive cognitive decline.}

  abstract = {Patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) can present as isolated lacunar infarction or with diffuse white matter changes, with the imaging appearance of leukoaraiosis. Endothelial dysfunction, which can lead to breakdown of the blood{\textendash}brain barrier, impaired cerebral autoregulation and prothrombotic changes, is believed to be important in mediating disease. Circulating levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1), thrombomodulin (TM), tissue factor (TF) and tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) are markers of endothelial activation and damage, and may provide insights into disease pathogenesis or differences between phenotypes. We therefore measured these markers in a prospective series of patients with lacunar stroke. One hundred and ten white Caucasian patients with previous lacunar stroke and 50 community control subjects were studied. Markers of endothelial function were measured on venous blood samples. Patients were classified on brain imaging into two groups: isolated lacunar infarction (n~=~47) and ischaemic leukoaraiosis, defined as a clinical lacunar stroke and leukoaraiosis on brain imaging (n~=~63). The number of lacunes and severity of leukoaraiosis were also scored on MRI. ICAM1, TM and TFPI were elevated in cerebral SVD subjects compared with controls (P~{$\leq~$}0.006). The ischaemic leukoaraiosis group had a different endothelial marker profile, with lower levels of TFPI (P~=~0.01) and a higher TF/TFPI ratio (P~=~0.01) compared with the isolated lacunar infarction group. TM levels were associated with the number of lacunes (P~=~0.008) and the leukoaraiosis score (P~=~0.03), but TF levels and the TF/TFPI ratio were associated only with the extent of leukoaraiosis (P~{$\leq~$}0.02). These results suggest that there is evidence of chronic endothelial dysfunction in cerebral SVD, and endothelial prothrombotic changes may be important in mediating the ischaemic leukoaraiosis phenotype. Therapies which help to stabilize the endothelium may have a role in this group of patients.}

  abstract = {Older adults (OA), relative to young adults (YA), exhibit age-related alterations in functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) activity during associative encoding, which contributes to deficits in source memory. Yet, there are remarkable individual differences in brain health and memory performance among OA. Cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is one individual difference factor that may attenuate brain aging, and thereby contribute to enhanced source memory in OA. To examine this possibility, 26 OA and 31 YA completed a treadmill-based exercise test to evaluate CRF (peak VO2) and fMRI~to examine brain activation during a face-name associative encoding task. Our results indicated that in OA, peak VO2 was positively associated with fMRI activity during associative encoding in multiple regions including bilateral prefrontal cortex, medial frontal cortex, bilateral thalamus and left hippocampus. Next, a conjunction analysis was conducted to assess whether CRF influenced age-related differences in fMRI activation. We classified OA as high or low CRF and compared their activation to YA. High fit OA (HFOA) showed fMRI activation more similar to YA than low fit OA (LFOA) (i.e., reduced age-related differences) in multiple regions including thalamus, posterior and prefrontal cortex. Conversely, in other regions, primarily in prefrontal cortex, HFOA, but not LFOA, demonstrated greater activation than YA (i.e., increased age-related differences). Further, fMRI activity in these brain regions was positively associated with source memory among OA, with a mediation model demonstrating that associative encoding activation in medial frontal cortex indirectly influenced the relationship between peak VO2 and subsequent source memory performance. These results indicate that CRF may contribute to neuroplasticity among OA, reducing age-related differences in some brain regions, consistent with the brain maintenance hypothesis, but accentuating age-differences in other regions, consistent with the brain compensation hypothesis.},

  abstract = {Summary. ROC curves are a popular method for displaying sensitivity and specificity of a continuous marker, X, for a binary disease variable, D. However, many disease outcomes are time dependent, D(t, and ROC curves that vary as a function of time may be mire appropriate. A common examples of a time-dependent variable is vital status, where D(t) = 1 if a patient has died prior to time t and zero otherwise. We propose summarizing the discrimination potential of a marker X, measured at baseline (t= 0), by calculating ROC Curves for cumulative disease or death incidence by time t, which we denote as ROC(t). A typical complexity with survival data is that observations may be censored. Two ROC curve estimators are proposed that can accommodate censored data. A simple estimator is based on using the Kaplan-Meier estimated for each possible subset X {$>$} c. However, this estimator does not guarantee the necessary condition that sensitivity and specificity are monotone in X. An alternative estimator that does guarantee monotonicity is based on a nearest neighbor estimator for the bivariate distribution function of (X, T), where T represents survival time (Akritas, M. J., 1994, Annals of Statistics22, 1299?1327). We present an example where ROC(t) is used to compare a standard and a modified flow cytometry measurement for predicting survival after detection of breast cancer and an example where the ROC(t) curve displays the impact of modifying eligibility criteria for sample size and power in HIV prevention trials.},

Previous studies have suggested that elevated Body Mass Index (BMI) might be associated with structural changes in both gray and white matter, but this association is still not well understood. The present study aimed to investigate the relationship between BMI and brain structure with a relatively large sample of young adults (N~=~336) in a small age range (20~{$\pm~$}1~years). Voxel-based morphometry results showed significant negative correlations between BMI and gray-matter volumes in the midcingulate cortex (MCC), left orbital frontal cortex, and left ventromedial prefrontal cortex. There was also a significant negative correlation between BMI and white matter integrity as indexed by fractional anisotropy in bilateral cingulum. Further tractography analysis showed a significant negative correlation between BMI and the number of fibers passing the MCC region. Regression analysis showed that gray matter and white matter in these regions both contributed to the variance of BMI. These results remained significant even when analysis was restricted to the subjects with normal weights. Finally, we found that decision-making ability (as assessed by the Iowa Gambling Task) mediated the association between the structure of the MCC (a region responsible for impulse control and decision making) and BMI. These results shed light on the structural neural basis of weight variations.}

RESULTS: WMHs and lacunes, but not cerebral microbleeds, were associated with smaller gray matter (GM) volumes. In analyses stratified by CSF amyloid status, WMHs and lacunes were associated with smaller total brain and GM volumes only in amyloid-negative patients. SVD-related atrophy was most evident in frontal (cortical) GM, again predominantly in amyloid-negative patients. DISCUSSION: Amyloid status modifies the differential relation between SVD lesion type and brain atrophy in memory clinic patients.},

  abstract = {Summary Obesity rates have increased dramatically in recent decades, and it has proven difficult to treat. An attentional bias towards food cues may be implicated in the aetiology of obesity and influence cravings and food consumption. This review systematically investigated whether attentional biases to food cues exist in overweight/obese compared with healthy weight individuals. Electronic database were searched for relevant papers from inception to October 2014. Only studies reporting food-related attentional bias between either overweight (body mass index [BMI] 25.0?29.9?kg?m?2) or obese (BMI?{$\geq$}?30) participants and healthy weight participants (BMI 18.5?24.9) were included. The findings of 19 studies were reported in this review. Results of the literature are suggestive of differences in attentional bias, with all but four studies supporting the notion of enhanced reactivity to food stimuli in overweight individuals and individuals with obesity. This support for attentional bias was observed primarily in studies that employed psychophysiological techniques (i.e. electroencephalogram, eye-tracking and functional magnetic resonance imaging). Despite the heterogeneous methodology within the featured studies, all measures of attentional bias demonstrated altered cue-reactivity in individuals with obesity. Considering the theorized implications of attentional biases on obesity pathology, researchers are encouraged to replicate flagship studies to strengthen these inferences.},

In this study, twenty-four participants were examined before, 30 and 120 min after ingesting 75 g of glucose solution or water on two separate days. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during visual food presentation was performed. All participants were genotyped for FTO SNP rs8050136. We detected significant differences between FTO genotypes in the prefrontal cortex 30 min post-glucose load in BOLD-response to food pictures (p=0.0017), while no differences were detected in response to water ingestion or 120 min post-glucose load. Since the prefrontal cortex plays a major role in the inhibitory control of eating, we propose that reduced postprandial activity in FTO risk allele carriers contributes to overeating and obesity.},

However, it is unclear how VS ratio affects different types of cerebrovascular lesions. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical impact of visceral fat accumulation on the cerebrovascular lesions. Methods This cross-sectional study included 980 apparently healthy Japanese adults who underwent a health check-up program focused toward atherosclerosis, between 2011 and 2014. Visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation was measured using abdominal computed tomography, and its relation to cerebrovascular disease was surveyed. Results Visceral and subcutaneous fat accumulation was 88~{$\pm~$}50~cm2 and 141~{$\pm~$}77~cm2, respectively. VS ratio was 0.69~{$\pm~$}0.38. Intimal thickening in the carotid arteries was detected in 849 cases (86.6\%) and stenosis was observed in seven (0.7\%). Brain magnetic resonance imaging showed white matter hyperintensities regarded as ischemic changes in 196 subjects (20.0\%). Multiple logistic regression analysis adjusted for age, gender, diabetes mellitus, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and hyperuricemia showed that a 0.1 increase in VS ratio was related to the presence of ischemic changes [odds ratio (OR): 1.05, 95\% CI: 1.01{\textendash}1.10, p~=~0.009], cerebral artery stenosis or occlusion (OR: 1.14, 95\% CI: 1.03{\textendash}1.25, p~=~0.007), and cervical plaque (OR: 1.09, 95\% CI: 1.05{\textendash}1.13, p~{$<~$}0.001).

The role of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in regulating emotional processing is increasingly being recognized along with its association with impulsive behavior. METHODS: Magnetic resonance imaging was used to measure the OFC in 107 high- and low-risk offspring (mean age 17.6 +/- 4.69 years) from either multiplex AD families or control families. Region of interest measures including segmented values were obtained by reliable raters using BRAINS2 software. Statistical analyses were adjusted for intracranial volume, age, socioeconomic status (SES), IQ, and handedness. The Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) was administered to determine scale scores for Control. Genotyping was performed for the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) gene and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) gene. RESULTS: High-risk offspring from multiplex for AD families showed decreased right/left OFC volumes in comparison with control subjects. Smaller volume in the right hemisphere was significantly associated with variation in the 5-HTT and BDNF genes. White matter (WM) ratios showed a positive correlation with MPQ Control scale scores, indicating that reduced OFC WM is related to greater impulsivity. CONCLUSIONS: Offspring from multiplex families for AD manifest genetic susceptibility by exhibiting disruption in the laterality of the OFC volume that is related to greater impulsivity (lower Control scale scores). This disruption in OFC laterality is related to variation in genes associated with neuronal growth.},

Control of portion size, consumption of a diet low in fat and energy density, and regular physical activity are behaviors that protect against obesity, but it is becoming difficult to adopt and maintain these behaviors in the current environment.

Albumin is a large molecule measured in CSF and blood to form the albumin index (Qalb), which is a global measure of BBB permeability, while the smaller Gadolinium molecule measures regional transfer (Ktrans); few studies have directly compared them in the same patients. We used both methods as part of a study of mechanisms of white matter injury in patients with different forms of dementia. In addition, we also measured biomarkers for inflammation, including proteases, angiogenic growth factors, and cytokines, and correlated them with the BBB results. We found that there was no correlation between Qalb and Ktrans. The Qalb was associated with the matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-2, MMP-3, and MMP-10), the angiogenic factors (VEGF-C and PlGF), and the cytokines (IL-6, IL-8 and TNF-{$\alpha$}). On the other hand, Ktrans was associated with the diffusion measures, mean free water and PSMD, which indicate white matter injury. Our results show that the Qalb and Ktrans measure different aspects of BBB permeability, with albumin being a measure of inflammatory BBB opening and Ktrans indicating white matter injury.}

An important problem with most ICA algorithms is, however, that they are stochastic; that is, their results may be somewhat different in different runs of the algorithm. Thus, the outputs of a single run of an ICA algorithm should be interpreted with some reserve, and further analysis of the algorithmic reliability of the components is needed. Moreover, as with any statistical method, the results are affected by the random sampling of the data, and some analysis of the statistical significance or reliability should be done as well. Here we present a method for assessing both the algorithmic and statistical reliability of estimated independent components. The method is based on running the ICA algorithm many times with slightly different conditions and visualizing the clustering structure of the obtained components in the signal space. In experiments with magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, the method was able to show that expected components are reliable; furthermore, it pointed out components whose interpretation was not obvious but whose reliability should incite the experimenter to investigate the underlying technical or physical phenomena. The method is implemented in a software package called Icasso.},

  abstract = {Brain-age (BA) estimates based on deep learning are increasingly used as neuroimaging biomarker for brain health; however, the underlying neural features have remained unclear. We combined ensembles of convolutional neural networks with Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) to detect which brain features contribute to BA. Trained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of a population-based study (n=2637, 18-82 years), our models estimated age accurately based on single and multiple modalities, regionally restricted and whole-brain images (mean absolute errors 3.37-3.86 years). We find that BA estimates capture aging at both small and large-scale changes, revealing gross enlargements of ventricles and subarachnoid spaces, as well as lesions, iron accumulations and atrophies that appear throughout the brain. Divergence from expected aging reflected cardiovascular risk factors and accelerated aging was more pronounced in the frontal lobe. Applying LRP, our study demonstrates how superior deep learning models detect brain-aging in healthy and at-risk individuals throughout adulthood.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

We sought to determine whether the spatial distribution of WMHs discriminates between different disease groups and healthy aging individuals and whether these distributions are related to local cerebral perfusion patterns. Methods{\textemdash} We examined the pattern of WMHs by T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery{\textendash}weighted magnetic resonance imaging in 3 groups of subjects: cerebral amyloid angiopathy (n=32), Alzheimer disease or mild cognitive impairment (n=41), and healthy aging (n=29). WMH frequency maps were calculated for each group, and spatial distributions were compared by voxel-wise logistic regression. WMHs were also analyzed as a function of normal cerebral perfusion patterns by overlaying a single photon emission computed tomography atlas. Results{\textemdash} Although WMH volume was greater in cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Alzheimer disease/mild cognitive impairment than in healthy aging, there was no consistent difference in the spatial distributions when controlling for total WMH volume. Hyperintensities were most frequent in the deep periventricular WM in all 3 groups. A strong inverse correlation between hyperintensity frequency and normal perfusion was demonstrated in all groups, demonstrating that WMHs were most common in regions of relatively lower normal cerebral perfusion. Conclusions{\textemdash} WMHs show a common distribution pattern and predilection for cerebral WM regions with lower atlas-derived perfusion, regardless of the underlying diagnosis. These data suggest that across diverse disease processes, WM injury may occur in a pattern that reflects underlying tissue properties, such as relative perfusion.},

  abstract = {Small vessel disease is a stroke subtype characterized by pathology of the small perforating arteries, which supply the sub-cortical structures of the brain. Small vessel disease is associated with high rates of apathy and depression, thought to be caused by a disruption of white matter cortical-subcortical pathways important for emotion regulation. It provides an important biological model to investigate mechanisms underlying these key neuropsychiatric disorders. This study investigated whether apathy and depression can be distinguished in small vessel disease both in terms of their relative relationship with white matter microstructure, and secondly whether they can independently predict functional outcomes. Participants with small vessel disease (n = 118; mean age = 68.9 years; 65\% male) defined as a clinical and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed lacunar stroke with radiological leukoaraiosis were recruited and completed cognitive testing, measures of apathy, depression, quality of life and diffusion tensor imaging. Healthy controls (n = 398; mean age = 64.3 years; 52\% male) were also studied in order to interpret the degree of apathy and depression found within the small vessel disease group. Firstly, a multilevel structural equation modelling approach was used to identify: (i) the relationships between median fractional anisotropy and apathy, depression and cognitive impairment; and (ii) if apathy and depression make independent contributions to quality of life in patients with small vessel disease. Secondly, we applied a whole-brain voxel-based analysis to investigate which regions of white matter were associated with apathy and depression, controlling for age, gender and cognitive functioning. Structural equation modelling results indicated both apathy (r = -0.23, P {$\leq$} 0.001) and depression (r = -0.41, P {$\leq$} 0.001) were independent predictors of quality of life. A reduced median fractional anisotropy was significantly associated with apathy (r = -0.38, P {$\leq$} 0.001), but not depression (r = -0.16, P = 0.09). On voxel-based analysis, apathy was associated with widespread reduction in white matter integrity, with the strongest effects in limbic association tracts such as the anterior cingulum, fornix and uncinate fasciculus. In contrast, when controlling for apathy, we found no significant relationship between our white matter parameters and symptoms of depression. In conclusion, white matter microstructural changes in small vessel disease are associated with apathy but not directly with depressive symptoms. These results suggest that apathy, but not depression, in small vessel disease is related to damage to cortical-subcortical networks associated with emotion regulation, reward and goal-directed behaviour.}

Here, we assessed obesity-related influences of gender on brain structure as well as performance in the Iowa Gambling Task. This task requires evaluation of both immediate rewards and long-term outcomes and thus mirrors the trade-off between immediate reward from eating and the long-term effect of overeating on body weight. In women, but not in men, we show that the preference for salient immediate rewards in the face of negative long-term consequences is higher in obese than in lean subjects. In addition, we report structural differences in the left dorsal striatum (i.e. putamen) and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex for women only. Functionally, both regions are known to play complimentary roles in habitual and goal-directed control of behavior in motivational contexts. For women as well as men, gray matter volume correlates positively with measures of obesity in regions coding the value and saliency of food (i.e. nucleus accumbens, orbitofrontal cortex) as well as in the hypothalamus (i.e. the brain's central homeostatic centre). These differences between lean and obese subjects in hedonic and homeostatic control systems may reflect a bias in eating behavior towards energy intake exceeding the actual homeostatic demand. Although we cannot infer from our results the etiology of the observed structural differences, our results resemble neural and behavioral differences well known from other forms of addiction, however, with marked differences between women and men. These findings are important for designing gender-appropriate treatments of obesity and possibly its recognition as a form of addiction.}

METHODS: We conducted a systematic review of published studies on existing dementia risk models. The models were assessed by sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC) from receiver operating characteristic analysis. RESULTS: Of 8462 studies reviewed, 61 articles describing dementia risk models were identified, with the majority of the articles modelling late life risk (n=39), followed by those modelling prediction of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease (n=15), mid-life risk (n=4) and patients with diabetes (n=3). Age, sex, education, Mini Mental State Examination, the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological assessment battery, Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-cognitive subscale, body mass index, alcohol intake and genetic variables are the most common predictors included in the models. Most risk models had moderate-to-high predictive ability (AUC{$>$}0.70). The highest AUC value (0.932) was produced from a risk model developed for patients with mild cognitive impairment. CONCLUSION: The predictive ability of existing dementia risk models is acceptable. Population-specific dementia risk models are necessary for populations and subpopulations with different characteristics.},

  abstract = {Nosologically, Alzheimer disease is not a single disorder in spite of a common clinical phenotype. Etiologically, two different types or even more exist. (1) In a minority of about 5\% or less of all cases, Alzheimer disease is due to mutations of three genes, resulting in the permanent generation of betaA4. (2) The great majority (95\% or more) of cases of Alzheimer disease are sporadic in origin, with old age as main risk factor, supporting the view that susceptibility genes and aging contribute to age-related sporadic Alzheimer disease. However, disturbances in the neuronal insulin signal transduction pathway may be of central pathophysiological significance. In early-onset familial Alzheimer disease, the inhibition of neuronal insulin receptor function may be due to competitive binding of amyloid beta (Abeta) to the insulin receptor. In late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease, the neuronal insulin receptor may be desensitized by inhibition of receptor function at different sites by noradrenaline and/or cortisol, the levels of which both increase with increasing age. The consequences of the inhibition of neuronal insulin signal transduction may be largely identical to those of disturbances of oxidative energy metabolism and related metabolism, and of hyperphosphorylation of tau-protein. As far as the metabolism of amyloid precursor protein (APP) in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease is concerned, neuronal insulin receptor dysfunction may result in the intracellular accumulation of Abeta and in subsequent cellular damage. In this context, the desensitization of the neuronal insulin receptor in late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease is different from that occurring in normal aging and early-onset familial Alzheimer disease. In late-onset sporadic Alzheimer disease changes in the brain are similar to those caused by non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.},

The possible neural mechanisms underlying the benefit of higher BMI on cognition in older adults are largely unknown. Thus, we used functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to examine: (1) the relationship between BMI and functional brain connectivity; and (2) the mediating role of functional brain connectivity in the association between baseline BMI and change in cognitive function over a 12-month period. METHODS: We conducted a 12-month, prospective study among 66 community-dwelling older adults, aged 70 to 80 years, who were categorized as: normal weight (BMI from 18.50 to 24.99); overweight (BMI from 25.00 to 29.99); and obese (BMI {$>$}/= 30.00). At baseline, participants performed a finger-tapping task during fMRI scanning. Relevant neural networks were initially identified through independent component analysis (ICA) and subsequently examined through seed-based functional connectivity analysis. At baseline and 12-months, we measured three executive cognitive processes: (1) response inhibition; (2) set shifting; and (3) working memory. RESULTS: Obese individuals showed lower task-related functional connectivity during finger tapping in the default mode network (DMN) compared with their healthy weight counterparts (p {$<$} 0.01). Lower task-related functional connectivity in the DMN at baseline was independently associated with better working memory performance at 12-months (p = 0.02). Finally, DMN functional connectivity during finger tapping significantly mediated the relationship between baseline BMI and working memory at 12-months (indirect effect: -0.155, 95\% confidence interval [-0.313, -0.053]). CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that functional connectivity of the DMN may be an underlying mechanism by which higher BMI confers protective effects to cognition in late life.},

However, it increased paracellular permeability at a higher dose. Agouti viable (A\textsuperscript{vy}) mice with adult-onset obesity show higher CRP entry into the brain. CRP did not permeate hCMEC/D3 cells nor change zona occludin-1 or cyclooxygenase-2 expression. An intermediate dose of CRP had no effect on leptin transport across the BBB after co-treatment. Thus, acute interactions between CRP and leptin at the BBB level were negligible and did not explain the leptin resistance seen in obesity. \textbf{\emph{Conclusions: }}The interactions of CRP and the BBB are a two-phase process, with increased paracellular permeability at a high dose that enables its entry into the CNS and serves to induce reactive gliosis and impair CNS function.}

Controversies persist about the effects of WMH on cognitive dysfunction. This meta-analysis aimed to identify the associations of WMH with risks of cognitive impairment and dementia. Methods We searched PubMed, EMBASE and Cochrane Library for prospective studies. Primary analyses of cognitive dysfunction and sub-analyses of specific outcomes and study characteristics were conducted using random-effect models. Results Thirty-six prospective studies with 19,040 participants were included. WMH at baseline conferred a 14 \% elevated risk of cognitive impairment and all-cause dementia (ACD). WMH also conferred 25 \% elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease and 73 \% elevated risk of vascular dementia. Risk effects of high-grade WMH and continually increasing WMH (in volume or severity) on ACD were revealed. Periventricular WMH conferred a 1.51-fold excess risk for dementia. Conclusions WMH were associated with increased risk of cognitive dysfunction and could become a neuroimaging indicator of dementia.},

Using a 2-index presentation strategy, which includes using the maximum likelihood (ML)-based standardized root mean squared residual (SRMR) and supplementing it with either Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI), Bollen's (1989) Fit Index (BL89), Relative Noncentrality Index (RNI), Comparative Fit Index (CFI), Gamma Hat, McDonald's Centrality Index (Mc), or root mean squared error of approximation (RMSEA), various combinations of cutoff values from selected ranges of cutoff criteria for the ML-based SRMR and a given supplemental fit index were used to calculate rejection rates for various types of true-population and misspecified models; that is, models with misspecified factor covariance(s) and models with misspecified factor loading(s). The results suggest that, for the ML method, a cutoff value close to .95 for TLI, BL89, CFI, RNI, and Gamma Hat; a cutoff value close to .90 for Mc; a cutoff value close to .08 for SRMR; and a cutoff value close to .06 for RMSEA are needed before we can conclude that there is a relatively good fit between the hypothesized model and the observed data. Furthermore, the 2-index presentation strategy is required to reject reasonable proportions of various types of true-population and misspecified models. Finally, using the proposed cutoff criteria, the ML-based TLI, Mc, and RMSEA tend to overreject true-population models at small sample size and thus are less preferable when sample size is small.},

However, the roles of WMHs in the periventricular white matter and deep white matter regions in the aging process remain controversial. This study aimed to investigate the WMH burden across the adult lifespan and determine the interrelationships among age, WMH, and cognition. The present study included 312 healthy individuals aged 21{\textendash}89~years who received structural magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive assessments. Periventricular WMH (PVWMH) and deep WMH (DWMH) volumes were computed and fitted using different regression models to evaluate the trajectory of WMH changes across the lifespan. Our findings support that the changes in WMH volume in the healthy population follow a nonlinear pattern with age, especially in PVWMH. With 2-mediator mediation analysis, we further suggest that the effect of age on the cognitive performance is mediated only by PVWMH. Conclusively, the increased PVWMH, but not DWMH, plays a major role in predicting cognitive aging in healthy adults.},

The goal was to examine longitudinal changes in multiple cognitive domains from early midlife through old age in a large national sample, the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. Methods: The Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone (BTACT) was administered on two occasions (MIDUS 2, MIDUS 3), an average of 9 years apart. At MIDUS 3, those with the cognitive assessment (N=2518) ranged in age from 42 to 92 years (M=64.30; SD=11.20) and had a mean education of 14.68 years (SD=2.63). The BTACT includes assessment of key aging-sensitive cognitive domains: immediate and delayed free recall, number series, category fluency, backward digit span, processing speed, and reaction time for attention switching and inhibitory control, which comprise two factors: episodic memory and executive functioning. Results: As predicted, all cognitive subtests and factors showed very small but significant declines over 9 years, with differences in the timing and extent of change. Processing speed showed the earliest and steepest decrements. Those with higher educational attainment scored better on all tests except reaction time. Men had better executive functioning and women performed better on episodic memory. Conclusions: Examining cognitive changes in midlife provides opportunities for early detection of cognitive impairments and possibilities for preventative interventions.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine arterial stiffness and {$\beta$}-amyloid (A{$\beta$}) deposition in the brain of dementia-free older adults. METHODS: We studied a cohort of 91 dementia-free participants aged 83-96 years. In 2009, participants completed brain MRI and PET imaging using Pittsburgh compound B (PiB; a marker of amyloid plaques in human brain). In 2011, we measured resting blood pressure (BP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and arterial stiffness by pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the central, peripheral, and mixed (e.g., brachial ankle PWV [baPWV]) vascular beds, using a noninvasive and automated waveform analyzer. RESULTS: A total of 44/91 subjects were A{$\beta$}-positive on PET scan. A{$\beta$} deposition was associated with mixed PWV, systolic BP, and MAP. One SD increase in baPWV resulted in a 2-fold increase in the odds of being A{$\beta$}-positive (p = 0.007). High white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden was associated with increased central PWV, systolic BP, and MAP. Compared to A{$\beta$}-negative individuals with low WMH burden, each SD increase in PWV was associated with a 2-fold to 4-fold increase in the odds of being A{$\beta$}-positive and having high WMH. CONCLUSIONS: Arterial stiffness was associated with A{$\beta$} plaque deposition in the brain, independent of BP and APOE {$\epsilon$}4 allele. The associations differed by type of brain abnormality and vascular bed measured (e.g., WMH with central stiffness and A{$\beta$} deposition and mixed stiffness). Arterial stiffness was highest in individuals with both high A{$\beta$} deposition and WMH, which has been suggested to be a "double hit" contributing to the development of symptomatic dementia.},

Magnetic resonance imaging assessment also included cerebral infarcts and atrophy.Main outcome measure Transition from no disability (defined as a score of 0 or 1 on the instrumental activities of daily living scale) to disability (score {$\geq$}2) or death over three year follow-up. Secondary outcomes were incident dementia and stroke.Results Over a mean follow-up period of 2.42 years (SD 0.97, median 2.94 years), information on the main outcome was available for 633 patients. The annual rate of transition or death was 10.5\%, 15.1\%, and 29.5\%, respectively, for patients with mild, moderate, or severe age related changes in white matter (Kaplan-Meier log rank test P\&amp;lt;0.001). In a Cox model comparing severe with mild changes and adjusted for clinical factors of functional decline, the risk of transition to disability or death was more than twofold higher (hazard ratio 2.36, 95\% confidence interval 1.65 to 3.81). The other predictors were age group, history of atrial fibrillation, and complaint of gait disturbances. The effect of severe changes remained significant independently of baseline degree of atrophy and number of infarcts. Incident stroke and dementia only slightly modified this effect.Conclusion The three year results of the LADIS study suggest that in older adults who seek medical attention for non-disabling complaints, severe age related changes in white matter independently and strongly predict rapid global functional decline.}

However, leptin receptors are highly expressed in many extra-hypothalamic brain regions and evidence is growing that leptin influences many central processes including cognition. Indeed, recent studies indicate that leptin is a potential cognitive enhancer as it markedly facilitates the cellular events underlying hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, including effects on glutamate receptor trafficking, neuronal morphology and activity-dependent synaptic plasticity. However, the ability of leptin to regulate hippocampal synaptic function markedly declines with age and aberrant leptin function has been linked to neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Here, we review the evidence supporting a cognitive enhancing role for the hormone leptin and discuss the therapeutic potential of using leptin-based agents to treat AD.}

  abstract = {Aging is associated with changes in plasma levels of several hormones. There are conflicting reports on whether circulating leptin levels change during aging, the possible explanation for which is that alterations in adiposity and body mass index (BMI) also occur. In this study we measured plasma leptin and other hormonal parameters known to influence leptin in 150 men and 320 women of a wide age (18{\textendash}77 yr) and BMI (18.5{\textendash}61.1 kg/m2) range. Subjects of each gender were separated into 2 groups of similar BMI, i.e. nonobese (BMI, \&lt;30) and obese (BMI, \&gt;30), and treated separately. Statistical analysis was performed, treating each group of subjects as a whole population or divided into age groups (\&lt;30, 30{\textendash}50, and \&gt;50 yr). BMI-adjusted leptin levels were progressively lower with increasing age in women, with a consistent fall after menopause (-21\%; P \&lt; 0.001); in men, leptin levels also tended to be lower in subjects more than 50 yr of age, but the reduction was not significant. Multiple linear regression analysis, performed on subjects treated either as a whole population or divided into obese and nonobese, showed that in both genders BMI and age were independent contributors of leptin levels, and there was an inverse relationship between leptin and age in both obese (standardized coefficient {$\beta$} = -0.25 in women and -0.23 in men; P \&lt; 0.01) and nonobese (-0.22 in women and -0.20 in men; P \&lt; 0.05) subjects. The correlation of leptin and age with plasma levels of sex and thyroid hormones, GH, insulin-like growth factor I, PRL, and insulin was also evaluated. The variables that correlated with leptin were included in a multiple regression model that included BMI and age. Testosterone in men (-0.43 in nonobese and -0.19 in obese; P \&lt; 0.05) and estradiol in women (0.22 in nonobese and 0.24 in obese; P \&lt; 0.05) were important contributors to leptin levels; also, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate in obese women (-0.16) and sex hormone-binding globulin in obese subjects of both genders (0.15 in women and 0.19 in men) were significant determinants in the model. However, none of the hormonal parameters abolished the negative correlation between leptin and age or the gender difference in leptin levels. In conclusion, our data show that in adult humans of different body weight, serum leptin gradually declines during aging; leptin reduction is higher in women than in men, but it is independent from BMI and other age-related endocrine changes.}

Among several hypotheses that have been formulated, the ?portal theory? proposes that the liver is directly exposed to increasing amounts of free fatty acids and pro-inflammatory factors released from visceral fat into the portal vein of obese patients, promoting the development of hepatic insulin resistance and liver steatosis. Thus, visceral obesity may be particularly hazardous in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Herein, we will critically review existing evidence for a potential contribution of portally drained free fatty acids and/or cytokines to the development of hepatic insulin resistance.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measurements of hippocampal volume were related to the risk of future conversion to Alzheimer's disease (AD) in elderly patients with a mild cognitive impairment (MCI) BACKGROUND: Persons who develop AD pass through a transitional state which can be characterized as a MCI. However, in some patients MCI is a more benign condition which may not progress to AD or may do so slowly. PATIENTS: Eighty consecutive patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of MCI were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry. METHODS: At entry into the study each patient received a MRI examination of the head from which the volumes of both hippocampi were measured. Patients were then followed longitudinally with approximately annual clinical/cognitive assessments. The primary endpoint was the crossover of individual MCI patients to the clinical diagnosis of AD during longitudinal clinical followup. RESULTS: Over the period of longitudinal observation, which averaged 32.6 months, 27 of the 80 MCI patients became demented. Hippocampal atrophy at baseline was associated with crossover from MCI to AD (relative risk, 0.69, p = 0.015). When hippocampal volume was entered into bivariate models with age, post menopausal estrogen replacement, standard neuropsychological tests, apolipoprotein E genotype, history of ischemic heart disease and hypertension the relative risks were not substantially different from that found univariately and the associations between hippocampal volume and crossover remained significant. CONCLUSION: In elderly patients with MCI, hippocampal atrophy determined by premorbid MRI-based volume measurements is predictive of subsequent conversion to AD.}

To explore the role of mixed Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies in clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia, we performed a comprehensive investigation of TDP-43, mixed pathologies, and clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia in a large cohort of community-dwelling older subjects. We tested the hypotheses that TDP-43 with Alzheimer's disease pathology is a common mixed pathology; is related to increased likelihood of expressing clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia; and that TDP-43 pathologic stage is an important determinant of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia. Data came from 946 older adults with (n = 398) and without dementia (n = 548) from the Rush Memory and Aging Project and Religious Orders Study. TDP-43 proteinopathy (cytoplasmic inclusions) was present in 496 (52\%) subjects, and the pattern of deposition was classified as stage 0 (none; 48\%), stage 1 (amygdala; 18\%), stage 2 (extension to hippocampus/entorhinal; 21\%), or stage 3 (extension to neocortex; 14\%). TDP-43 pathology combined with a pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was a common mixed pathology (37\% of all participants), and the proportion of subjects with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia formerly labelled `pure pathologic diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease' was halved when TDP-43 was considered. In logistic regression models adjusted for age, sex, and education, TDP-43 pathology was associated with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia (odds ratio = 1.51, 95\% confidence interval = 1.11, 2.05) independent of pathological Alzheimer's disease (odds ratio = 4.30, 95\% confidence interval = 3.08, 6.01) or other pathologies (infarcts, arteriolosclerosis, Lewy bodies, and hippocampal sclerosis). Mixed Alzheimer's disease and TDP-43 pathologies were associated with higher odds of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia (odds ratio = 6.73, 95\% confidence interval = 4.18, 10.85) than pathologic Alzheimer's disease alone (odds ratio = 4.62, 95\% confidence interval = 2.84, 7.52). In models examining TDP-43 stage, a dose-response relationship with clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia was observed, and a significant association was observed starting at stage 2, extension beyond the amygdala. In this large sample from almost 1000 community participants, we observed that TDP-43 proteinopathy was very common, frequently mixed with pathological Alzheimer's disease, and associated with a higher likelihood of the clinical expression of clinical Alzheimer's-type dementia but only when extended beyond the amygdala.}

We sought replication in a second, independent population sample (SHIP-TREND, N = 1586). In a combined analysis (SHIP-2 and SHIP-TREND) we investigated the impact of hypertension, type II diabetes and blood lipids on the association between waist circumference and gray matter. Volumetric analysis revealed a significant inverse association between waist circumference and gray matter volume. VBM in SHIP-2 indicated distinct inverse associations in the following structures for both hemispheres: frontal lobe, temporal lobes, pre- and postcentral gyrus, supplementary motor area, supramarginal gyrus, insula, cingulate gyrus, caudate nucleus, olfactory sulcus, para-/hippocampus, gyrus rectus, amygdala, globus pallidus, putamen, cerebellum, fusiform and lingual gyrus, (pre-) cuneus and thalamus. These areas were replicated in SHIP-TREND. More than 76\% of the voxels with significant gray matter volume reduction in SHIP-2 were also distinct in TREND. These brain areas are involved in cognition, attention to interoceptive signals as satiety or reward and control food intake. Due to our cross-sectional design we cannot clarify the causal direction of the association. However, previous studies described an association between subjects with higher waist circumference and future cognitive decline suggesting a progressive brain alteration in obese subjects. Pathomechanisms may involve chronic inflammation, increased oxidative stress or cellular autophagy associated with obesity.}

Participants were 623 community-dwelling adults from the Whitehall II Imaging Sub-study with multi-modal MRI (mean age 69.96, SD\,=\,5.18, 79\% men). We used linear mixed-effects models to investigate associations of SVD burden with up to 25-year retrospective trajectories of vascular risk and cognitive performance. General linear modelling was used to investigate concurrent associations with grey matter (GM) density and white matter (WM) microstructure, and whether these associations were modified by cognitive status (Montreal Cognitive Asessment [MoCA] scores of {$<$} 26 vs. {$\geq$} 26). Severe SVD burden in older age was associated with higher mean arterial pressure throughout midlife ({$\beta$}\,=\,3.36, 95\% CI [0.42-6.30]), and faster cognitive decline in letter fluency ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.07, 95\% CI [-0.13{\textendash}-0.01]), and verbal reasoning ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.05, 95\% CI [-0.11{\textendash}-0.001]). Moreover, SVD burden was related to lower GM volumes in 9.7\% of total GM, and widespread WM microstructural decline (FWE-corrected p\,{$<$}\,0.05). The latter association was most pronounced in individuals who demonstrated cognitive impairments on MoCA (MoCA {$<$} 26; F3,608\,=\,2.14, p\,=\,0.007). These findings highlight the importance of managing midlife vascular health to preserve brain structure and cognitive function in old age.},

Though the advice might be correct, it appears to be extremely difficult to change one's lifestyle. Unhealthy habits usually are ingrained and hard to change, especially for people with an ``obese cognitive profile.'' Knowledge of the cognitive mechanisms that maintain unhealthy eating habits is necessary for the development of interventions that can change behavior effectively. This paper discusses some cognitive processes that might maintain unhealthy eating habits and make healthier eating difficult, like increased food cue reactivity, weak executive skills and attention bias. An effort is also done to translate these basic scientific findings into new interventions which aim to tackle the sabotaging cognitive processes. Preliminary studies into the effectiveness of these interventions, if available, are presented.}

  abstract = {Background: Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a common cause of stroke, mild cognitive impairment, dementia and physical impairments. Differences in SVD incidence or severity between males and females are unknown. We assessed sex differences in SVD by assessing the male-to-female ratio (M:F) of recruited participants and incidence of SVD, risk factor presence, distribution, and severity of SVD features.Methods: We assessed four recent systematic reviews on SVD and performed a supplementary search of MEDLINE to identify studies reporting M:F ratio in covert, stroke, or cognitive SVD presentations (registered protocol: CRD42020193995). We meta-analyzed differences in sex ratios across time, countries, SVD severity and presentations, age and risk factors for SVD.Results: Amongst 123 relevant studies (n = 36,910 participants) including 53 community-based, 67 hospital-based and three mixed studies published between 1989 and 2020, more males were recruited in hospital-based than in community-based studies [M:F = 1.16 (0.70) vs. M:F = 0.79 (0.35), respectively; p {$<$} 0.001]. More males had moderate to severe SVD [M:F = 1.08 (0.81) vs. M:F = 0.82 (0.47) in healthy to mild SVD; p {$<$} 0.001], and stroke presentations where M:F was 1.67 (0.53). M:F did not differ for recent (2015{\textendash}2020) vs. pre-2015 publications, by geographical region, or age. There were insufficient sex-stratified data to explore M:F and risk factors for SVD.Conclusions: Our results highlight differences in male-to-female ratios in SVD severity and amongst those presenting with stroke that have important clinical and translational implications. Future SVD research should report participant demographics, risk factors and outcomes separately for males and females.Systematic Review Registration: [PROSPERO], identifier [CRD42020193995].},

Recently, it was observed that carriers of the A1 allele (A1+ subjects) showed impaired learning from negative feedback in a reinforcement learning task. Here, using functional MRI (fMRI), we investigated carriers and noncarriers of the A1 allele while they performed a probabilistic reversal learning task. A1+ subjects showed subtle deficits in reversal learning. In particular, these deficits consisted of an impairment in sustaining the newly rewarded response after a reversal and in a generally decreased tendency to stick with a rewarded response. Both genetic groups showed increased fMRI signal in response to negative feedback in the rostral cingulate zone (RCZ) and anterior insula. Negative feedback that incurred a change in behavior additionally engaged the ventral striatum and a region of the midbrain consistent with the location of dopaminergic cell groups. The response of the RCZ to negative feedback increased as a function of preceding negative feedback. However, this graded response was not observed in the A1+ group. Furthermore, the A1+ group also showed diminished recruitment of the right ventral striatum and the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lOFC) during reversals. Together, these results suggest that a genetically driven reduction in DA D2 receptors leads to deficient feedback integration in RCZ. This, in turn, was accompanied by impaired recruitment of the ventral striatum and the right lOFC during reversals, which might explain the behavioral differences between the genetic groups.}

The application of deep learning to early detection and automated classification of Alzheimer's disease (AD) has recently gained considerable attention, as rapid progress in neuroimaging techniques has generated large-scale multimodal neuroimaging data. A systematic review of publications using deep learning approaches and neuroimaging data for diagnostic classification of AD was performed. A PubMed and Google Scholar search was used to identify deep learning papers on AD published between January 2013 and July 2018. These papers were reviewed, evaluated, and classified by algorithm and neuroimaging type, and the findings were summarized. Of 16 studies meeting full inclusion criteria, 4 used a combination of deep learning and traditional machine learning approaches, and 12 used only deep learning approaches. The combination of traditional machine learning for classification and stacked auto-encoder (SAE) for feature selection produced accuracies of up to 98.8\% for AD classification and 83.7\% for prediction of conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI), a prodromal stage of AD, to AD. Deep learning approaches, such as convolutional neural network (CNN) or recurrent neural network (RNN), that use neuroimaging data without pre-processing for feature selection have yielded accuracies of up to 96.0\% for AD classification and 84.2\% for MCI conversion prediction. The best classification performance was obtained when multimodal neuroimaging and fluid biomarkers were combined. Deep learning approaches continue to improve in performance and appear to hold promise for diagnostic classification of AD using multimodal neuroimaging data. AD research that uses deep learning is still evolving, improving performance by incorporating additional hybrid data types, such as{\textemdash}omics data, increasing transparency with explainable approaches that add knowledge of specific disease-related features and mechanisms.}

Current clinical diagnostic criteria for dementia have sufficient accuracy to be applied in clinical practice (B) and brain imaging can improve diagnostic accuracy (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine) are effective for mild to moderate Alzheimer?s disease (A) and memantine for moderate to severe Alzheimer?s disease (A). Until further evidence is available other drugs, including statins, anti-inflammatory drugs, vitamin E and Ginkgo biloba, cannot be recommended either for the treatment or prevention of Alzheimer?s disease (A). Neither cholinesterase inhibitors nor memantine are effective in those with mild cognitive impairment (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors are not effective in frontotemporal dementia and may cause agitation (A), though selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors may help behavioural (but not cognitive) features (B). Cholinesterase inhibitors should be used for the treatment of people with Lewy body dementias (Parkinson?s disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB)), especially for neuropsychiatric symptoms (A). Cholinesterase inhibitors and memantine can produce cognitive improvements in DLB (A). There is no clear evidence that any intervention can prevent or delay the onset of dementia. Although the consensus statement focuses on medication, psychological interventions can be effective in addition to pharmacotherapy, both for cognitive and non-cognitive symptoms. Many novel pharmacological approaches involving strategies to reduce amyloid and/or tau deposition are in progress. Although results of pivotal studies are awaited, results to date have been equivocal and no disease-modifying agents are either licensed or can be currently recommended for clinical use.}

A broader goal is to illustrate why so many researchers are enthusiastic about the SEM approach to data analysis. We first outline some classic problems in longitudinal data analysis, consider definitions of differences and changes, and raise issues about measurement errors. We then present several classic SEMs based on the inclusion of invariant common factors and explain why these are so important. This leads to newer SEMs based on latent change scores, and we explain why these are useful.},

Whereas excessive caloric intake and physical inactivity are likely important factors driving the obesity epidemic, it is important to consider additional mechanisms. We revisit an old hypothesis that sugar, particularly excessive fructose intake, has a critical role in the epidemic of cardiorenal disease. We also present evidence that the unique ability of fructose to induce an increase in uric acid may be a major mechanism by which fructose can cause cardiorenal disease. Finally, we suggest that high intakes of fructose in African Americans may explain their greater predisposition to develop cardiorenal disease, and we provide a list of testable predictions to evaluate this hypothesis.},

Some individuals (n~=~125) eventually developed DAT; the others (n~=~324) remained without dementia. Body weight was measured at each annual assessment. Piecewise linear regression and random effects models were used to test longitudinal rates of weight change between the groups.Results~ Participants without dementia lost about 0.6 lb per year. For those individuals who developed DAT, about 1 year before the detection of DAT, the rate of weight loss doubled (1.2 lb per year). As a group, participants who eventually developed DAT weighed less (about 8 pounds) at study enrollment (ie, when they did not have dementia) than participants who remained without dementia.Conclusions~ Aging with and without DAT is associated with weight loss; however, weight loss may accelerate before the diagnosis of DAT. Specific factors contributing to weight loss are unknown, but these data suggest they operate before the development of DAT. Hence, weight loss may be a preclinical indicator of Alzheimer disease.}

The correspondence between neuroimaging findings and the severity of clinical symptoms has been modest, however, and thus the outcome may be affected by various host factors. We investigated the predictive value of educational and occupational attainments as proxy measures of cognitive reserve on long-term cognitive and functional outcome in patients with different degrees of WMH.Methods In the Leukoaraiosis and Disability (LADIS) study, 615 older individuals with WMH were evaluated with brain MRI and detailed clinical and neuropsychological assessments at 3-year follow-up. A prolonged follow-up of functional and cognitive status was administered with a structured telephone interview after up to 7\hspace{0.25em}years.Results Higher levels of educational and occupational attainment were strongly related to baseline cognitive scores and predicted a slower rate of decline at 3-year follow-up in measures of processing speed, executive functions and memory independently of WMH volume and other confounders. The deleterious effect of WMH on processing speed and memory was moderated by education and occupation. Education mitigated the relation of WMH volume on 7-year cognitive status. Moreover, higher education and occupational attainments were related to favourable outcome at 7-year follow-up as defined by sustained functional independence and lower mortality.Conclusions The results support the presumption that cognitive reserve plays a significant role as a buffer against the clinical manifestations of SVD and may in part explain high individual variability in outcome.}

While the clinical significance of WML is better understood, the contribution of lacunes to the rate of cognitive decline has not been established. This study investigated whether incident lacunes on MRI determine longitudinal cognitive change in elderly subjects with WML. Methods: Within the Leukoaraiosis and Disability Study (LADIS), 387 subjects were evaluated with repeated MRI and neuropsychological assessment at baseline and after 3 years. Predictors of change in global cognitive function and specific cognitive domains over time were analyzed with multivariate linear regression. Results: After controlling for demographic factors, baseline cognitive performance, baseline lacunar and WML lesion load, and WML progression, the number of new lacunes was related to subtle decrease in compound scores for executive functions (p = 0.021) and speed and motor control (p = 0.045), but not for memory or global cognitive function. Irrespective of lacunes, WML progression was associated with decrease in executive functions score (p = 0.016). Conclusion: Incident lacunes on MRI parallel a steeper rate of decline in executive functions and psychomotor speed. Accordingly, in addition to WML, lacunes determine longitudinal cognitive impairment in small vessel disease. Although the individual contribution of lacunes on cognition was modest, they cannot be considered benign findings, but indicate a risk of progressive cognitive impairment.}

The subjects with SIVD presented significantly steeper decline of performance in the Stroop test (parts I and II), Trail Making A test, Verbal fluency test, and Mini-Mental State Examination. They also had a threefold risk of developing dementia during follow-up independently of age, sex, education and medial temporal lobe atrophy. \emph{Conclusions:} SIVD, as a manifestation of cerebral small vessel disease, is related to progressive cognitive impairment and a considerable risk of developing dementia.

  abstract = {Studies have shown that aerobic exercise has the potential to improve cognition and reduce brain atrophy in older adults. However, the literature is equivocal with regards to the specificity or generality of these effects. To this end, we report results on cognitive function and brain structure from a 6-month training intervention with 60 sedentary adults (64{\textendash}78 years) randomized to either aerobic training or stretching and toning control training. Cognitive functions were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery in which cognitive constructs were measured using several different tests. Freesurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness in frontal regions and hippocampus volume. Results showed that aerobic exercisers, compared to controls, exhibited a broad, rather than specific, improvement in cognition as indexed by a higher ``Cognitive score,'' a composite including episodic memory, processing speed, updating, and executive function tasks (p = 0.01). There were no group differences in cortical thickness, but additional analyses revealed that aerobic fitness at baseline was specifically related to larger thickness in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), and hippocampus volume was positively associated with increased aerobic fitness over time. Moreover, ``Cognitive score'' was related to dlPFC thickness at baseline, but changes in ``Cognitive score'' and dlPFC thickness were associated over time in the aerobic group only. However, aerobic fitness did not predict dlPFC change, despite the improvement in ``Cognitive score'' in aerobic exercisers. Our interpretation of these observations is that potential exercise-induced changes in thickness are slow, and may be undetectable within 6-months, in contrast to change in hippocampus volume which in fact was predicted by the change in aerobic fitness. To conclude, our results add to a growing literature suggesting that aerobic exercise has a broad influence on cognitive functioning, which may aid in explaining why studies focusing on a narrower range of functions have sometimes reported mixed results.}

However, the literature is equivocal with regards to the specificity or generality of these effects. To this end, we report results on cognitive function and brain structure from a 6-month training intervention with 60 sedentary adults (64-78yrs) randomized to either aerobic training or stretching and toning control training. Cognitive functions were assessed with a neuropsychological test battery in which cognitive constructs were measured using several different tests. Freesurfer was used to estimate cortical thickness in frontal regions and hippocampus volume.

  abstract = {Brain atrophy, measured by MRI, has been proposed as a useful surrogate marker for disease progression in multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it is conventionally assumed that the accurate quantification of brain atrophy is made difficult, if not impossible, by changes in the parameters of the MRI acquisition, which are almost inevitable over the course of a longitudinal study since MRI technology changes rapidly. This state of affairs can negatively affect clinical trial design and limit the use of historical data. Here, we investigate whether we can coherently estimate brain atrophy rates in a heterogeneous MS sample via linear mixed-effects multivariable regression, incorporating three critical assumptions: (1) using age at time of scanning, rather than time since baseline, as the regressor of interest; (2) scanning individuals with a variety of techniques; and (3) introducing a simple additive correction for major differences in MRI protocol. We fit the model to several measures of brain volume as the outcome in two MS populations: 1123 scans from 195 cases acquired for over approximately 7years in two natural history protocols (Cohort 1), and 1331 scans from 69 cases seen for over 11years who were primarily treated with two specific MS disease-modifying therapies (Cohort 2). We compared the mixed-effects model with additive correction for MRI acquisition parameters to a model fit without this correction and performed sample-size calculations to provide an estimate of the number of participants in an MS clinical trial that might be required to see a therapeutic effect of treatment using the approach described here. The results show that without the additive correction for T1-weighted protocol parameters, atrophy was underestimated and subject-specific estimates were more narrowly distributed about the population mean. Ventricular CSF is the most consistently estimated brain volume, with a mean of 2.8\%/year increase in Cohort 1 and 4.4\%/year increase in Cohort 2. An interesting observation was that gray matter volume decreased and white matter volume remained essentially unchanged in both cohorts, suggesting that changes in ventricular CSF volume are a surrogate for changes in gray matter volume. In conclusion, the mixed-effects modeling framework presented here allows effective use of heterogeneously acquired and historical data in the study of brain atrophy in MS, potentially simplifying the design of future single- and multi-site clinical trials and natural history studies.},

  abstract = {Aging in later life engenders numerous changes to the cerebral microvasculature. Such changes can remain clinically silent but are associated with greater risk for negative health outcomes over time. Knowledge is limited about the pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment of potentially detrimental changes in the cerebral microvasculature that occur with advancing age. In this review, we summarize literature on aging of the cerebral microvasculature, and we propose a conceptual framework to fill existing research gaps and advance future work on this heterogeneous phenomenon. We propose that the major gaps in this area are attributable to an incomplete characterization of cerebrovascular pathology, the populations being studied, and the temporality of exposure to risk factors. Specifically, currently available measures of age-related cerebral microvasculature changes are indirect, primarily related to parenchymal damage rather than direct quantification of small vessel damage, limiting the understanding of cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) itself. Moreover, studies seldom account for variability in the health-related conditions or interactions with risk factors, which are likely determinants of cSVD pathogenesis. Finally, study designs are predominantly cross-sectional and/or have relied on single time point measures, leaving no clear evidence of time trajectories of risk factors or of change in cerebral microvasculature. We argue that more resources should be invested in 1) developing methodological approaches and basic science models to better understand the pathogenic and etiological nature of age-related brain microvascular diseases and 2) implementing state-of-the-science population study designs that account for the temporal evolution of cerebral microvascular changes in diverse populations across the lifespan.},

  abstract = {Large-scale longitudinal multi-site MRI brain morphometry studies are becoming increasingly crucial to characterize both normal and clinical population groups using fully automated segmentation tools. The test{\textendash}retest reproducibility of morphometry data acquired across multiple scanning sessions, and for different MR vendors, is an important reliability indicator since it defines the sensitivity of a protocol to detect longitudinal effects in a consortium. There is very limited knowledge about how across-session reliability of morphometry estimates might be affected by different 3T MRI systems. Moreover, there is a need for optimal acquisition and analysis protocols in order to reduce sample sizes. A recent study has shown that the longitudinal FreeSurfer segmentation offers improved within session test{\textendash}retest reproducibility relative to the cross-sectional segmentation at one 3T site using a nonstandard multi-echo MPRAGE sequence. In this study we implement a multi-site 3T MRI morphometry protocol based on vendor provided T1 structural sequences from different vendors (3D MPRAGE on Siemens and Philips, 3D IR-SPGR on GE) implemented in 8 sites located in 4 European countries. The protocols used mild acceleration factors (1.5{\textendash}2) when possible. We acquired across-session test{\textendash}retest structural data of a group of healthy elderly subjects (5 subjects per site) and compared the across-session reproducibility of two full-brain automated segmentation methods based on either longitudinal or cross-sectional FreeSurfer processing. The segmentations include cortical thickness, intracranial, ventricle and subcortical volumes. Reproducibility is evaluated as absolute changes relative to the mean (\%), Dice coefficient for volume overlap and intraclass correlation coefficients across two sessions. We found that this acquisition and analysis protocol gives comparable reproducibility results to previous studies that used longer acquisitions without acceleration. We also show that the longitudinal processing is systematically more reliable across sites regardless of MRI system differences. The reproducibility errors of the longitudinal segmentations are on average approximately half of those obtained with the cross sectional analysis for all volume segmentations and for entorhinal cortical thickness. No significant differences in reliability are found between the segmentation methods for the other cortical thickness estimates. The average of two MPRAGE volumes acquired within each test{\textendash}retest session did not systematically improve the across-session reproducibility of morphometry estimates. Our results extend those from previous studies that showed improved reliability of the longitudinal analysis at single sites and/or with non-standard acquisition methods. The multi-site acquisition and analysis protocol presented here is promising for clinical applications since it allows for smaller sample sizes per MRI site or shorter trials in studies evaluating the role of potential biomarkers to predict disease progression or treatment effects.},

The variability between hippocampal, thalamic, caudate, putamen, lateral ventricular and total intracranial volume measures across sessions on the same scanner on different days is less than 4.3\% for the older group and less than 2.3\% for the younger group. Within-scanner measurements are remarkably reliable across scan sessions, being minimally affected by averaging of multiple acquisitions, B1 correction, acquisition sequence (MPRAGE vs. multi-echo-FLASH), major scanner upgrades (Sonata{\textendash}Avanto, Trio{\textendash}TrioTIM), and segmentation atlas (MPRAGE or multi-echo-FLASH). Volume measurements across platforms (Siemens Sonata vs. GE Signa) and field strengths (1.5~T vs. 3~T) result in a volume difference bias but with a comparable variance as that measured within-scanner, implying that multi-site studies may not necessarily require a much larger sample to detect a specific effect. These results suggest that volumes derived from automated segmentation of T1-weighted structural images are reliable measures within the same scanner platform, even after upgrades; however, combining data across platform and across field-strength introduces a bias that should be considered in the design of multi-site studies, such as clinical drug trials. The results derived from the young groups (scanner upgrade effects and B1 inhomogeneity correction effects) should be considered as preliminary and in need for further validation with a larger dataset.},

We applied an image distortion correction method based on spherical harmonics description of the gradients and verified the accuracy of the method using phantom data. The correction method was then applied to the brain image data from a group of subjects scanned twice at multiple sites having different 1.5 T platforms. Within-site and across-site variability of the image data was assessed by evaluating voxel-based image intensity reproducibility. The image intensity reproducibility of the human brain data was significantly improved with distortion correction, suggesting that this method may offer improved reproducibility in morphometry studies.

  abstract = {Vascular stiffness increases with advancing age and is a major risk factor for age-related morbidity and mortality. Vascular stiffness and blood pressure pulsatility are related; however, temporal relationships between vascular stiffening and blood pressure elevation have not been fully delineated.To examine temporal relationships among vascular stiffness, central hemodynamics, microvascular function, and blood pressure progression.Longitudinal community-based cohort study conducted in Framingham, Massachusetts. The present investigation is based on the 2 latest examination cycles (cycle 7: 1998-2001; cycle 8: 2005-2008 [last visit: January 25, 2008]) of the Framingham Offspring study (recruited: 1971-1975). Temporal relationships among blood pressure and 3 measures of vascular stiffness and pressure pulsatility derived from arterial tonometry (carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity [CFPWV], forward wave amplitude [FWA], and augmentation index) were examined over a 7-year period in 1759 participants (mean [SD] age: 60 [9] years; 974 women).The primary outcomes were blood pressure and incident hypertension during examination cycle 8. The secondary outcomes were CFPWV, FWA, and augmentation index during examination cycle 8.In a multivariable-adjusted regression model, higher FWA ({$\beta$}, 1.3 [95\% CI, 0.5-2.1] mm Hg per 1 SD; P~=~.002) and higher CFPWV ({$\beta$}, 1.5 [95\% CI, 0.5-2.6] mm Hg per 1 SD; P~=~.006) during examination cycle 7 were jointly associated with systolic blood pressure during examination cycle 8. Similarly, in a model that included systolic and diastolic blood pressure and additional risk factors during examination cycle 7, higher FWA (odds ratio [OR], 1.6 [95\% CI, 1.3-2.0] per 1 SD; P~\&lt;~.001), augmentation index (OR, 1.7 [95\% CI, 1.4-2.0] per 1 SD; P~\&lt;~.001), and CFPWV (OR, 1.3 [95\% CI, 1.0-1.6] per 1 SD; P~=~.04) were associated with incident hypertension during examination cycle 8 (338 cases [32\%] in 1048 participants without hypertension during examination cycle 7). Conversely, blood pressure during examination cycle 7 was not associated with CFPWV during examination cycle 8. Higher resting brachial artery flow (OR, 1.23 [95\% CI, 1.04-1.46]) and lower flow-mediated dilation (OR, 0.80 [95\% CI, 0.67-0.96]) during examination cycle 7 were associated with incident hypertension (in models that included blood pressure and tonometry measures collected during examination cycle 7).In this cohort, higher aortic stiffness, FWA, and augmentation index were associated with higher risk of incident hypertension; however, initial blood pressure was not independently associated with risk of progressive aortic stiffening.},

Studies of monkey and rodent anatomy suggest that parallel pathways converge on distinct subregions of the MTL. To explore the cortical areas linked to subregions of the MTL in humans, we examined cortico-cortical and hippocampal-cortical correlations using high-resolution, functional connectivity analysis in 100 individuals. MTL seed regions extended along the anterior to posterior axis and included hippocampus and adjacent structures. Results revealed two separate brain pathways that correlated with distinct subregions within the MTL. The body of the hippocampus and posterior parahippocampal cortex correlated with lateral parietal cortex, regions along the posterior midline including posterior cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, and ventral medial prefrontal cortex. By contrast, anterior hippocampus and the perirhinal/entorhinal cortices correlated with distinct regions in the lateral temporal cortex extending into the temporal pole. The present results are largely consistent with known connectivity in the monkey and provide a novel task-independent dissociation of the parallel pathways supporting the MTL memory system in humans. The cortical pathways include regions that have undergone considerable areal expansion in humans, providing insight into how the MTL memory system has evolved to support a diverse array of cognitive domains.}

This review considers how modifiable risk factors such as hypertension, atherosclerosis, diabetes, dyslipidaemia and adiposity may impact on vascular structure and function to promote neurodegenerative processes and instigate AD. The presence of vascular pathology involving arterial stiffness, arteriolosclerosis, endothelial degeneration and blood{\textendash}brain barrier dysfunction leads to chronic cerebral hypoperfusion. Pathological changes in human brain and animal studies suggest cerebral hypoperfusion which in turn induces several features of AD pathology including selective brain atrophy, white matter changes and accumulation of abnormal proteins such as amyloid {$\beta$}. Cerebral pathological changes may be further modified by genetic factors such as the apoliopoprotein E {$\epsilon$}4 allele. Although tau hyperphosphorylation and tangle formation still needs robust explanation further support for the notion that vascular pathology influences AD changes is provided by the evidence that interventions which improve vascular function attenuate AD pathology.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are pathologic brain changes that are associated with increased age and cognitive decline. However, the association of WMH burden with amyloid positivity and conversion to dementia in people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is unclear. The aim of this study was to expand on this research by examining whether change in WMH burden over time differs in amyloid-negative (A{$\beta-$}) and amyloid-positive (A{$\beta$}+) people with MCI who either remain stable or convert to dementia. To examine this question, we compared regional WMH burden in 4 groups: A{$\beta$}+ progressor, A{$\beta-$} progressor, A{$\beta$}+ stable, and A{$\beta-$} stable. Methods Participants with MCI from the Alzheimer Disease Neuroimaging Initiative were included if they had APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 status and if amyloid measures were available to determine amyloid status (i.e., A{$\beta$}+, or A{$\beta-$}). Participants with a baseline diagnosis of MCI and who had APOE {$\varepsilon$}4 information and amyloid measures were included. An average of 5.7 follow-up time points per participant were included, with a total of 5,054 follow-up time points with a maximum follow-up duration of 13 years. Differences in total and regional WMH burden were examined using linear mixed-effects models. Results A total of 820 participants (55{\textendash}90 years of age) were included in the study (A{$\beta$}+ progressor, n = 239; A{$\beta-$} progressor, n = 22; A{$\beta$}+ stable, n = 343; A{$\beta-$} stable, n = 216). People who were A{$\beta-$} stable exhibited reduced baseline WMH compared with A{$\beta$}+ progressors and people who were A{$\beta$}+ stable at all regions of interest ({$\beta$} belongs to 0.20{\textendash}0.33, CI belongs to 0.03{\textendash}0.49, p {$<$} 0.02), except deep WMH. When examining longitudinal results, compared with people who were A{$\beta-$} stable, all groups had steeper accumulation in WMH burden with A{$\beta$}+ progressors ({$\beta$} belongs to -0.03 to 0.06, CI belongs to -0.05 to 0.09, p {$<$} 0.01) having the largest increase (i.e., largest increase in WMH accumulation over time). Discussion These results indicate that WMH accumulation contributes to conversion to dementia in older adults with MCI who are A{$\beta$}+ and A{$\beta-$}.},

  abstract = {Although cross-sectional studies suggest that cognitive aging starts in midlife, few longitudinal studies have documented within-individual declines in cognitive performance before the seventh decade. Learning from repeat testing, or practice effects, can mask the decline in younger cohorts. In women, the menopause transition also affects test performance and can confound estimates of underlying decline. We designed this study to determine if, after controlling for practice effects, the menopause transition, and the symptoms associated with it, there is evidence of cognitive aging in midlife women. We used data from a longitudinal observational study in 2,124 participants from the Study of Women's Health Across the Nation. Outcomes examined were scores on annual tests of processing speed, verbal episodic memory (immediate and delayed), and working memory. To reduce the impact of practice effects and of the menopause transition, we used the third cognition testing visit as the baseline. Average age at this baseline was 54 years, and the majority of the women were postmenopausal; half the cohort was 2 or more years beyond the final menstrual period. There were 7,185 cognition assessments with median follow-up time of 6.5 years. In mixed effects regression, adjusted for practice effects, retention, menopause symtoms (depressive, anxiety, vasomotor, and sleep disturbance), and covariates, scores on 2 of 4 cognition tests declined. Mean decline in cognitive speed was 0.28 per year (95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.20 to 0.36) or 4.9\% in 10 years, and mean decline in verbal episodic memory (delayed testing) was 0.02 per year (95\% CI: 0.00 to 0.03) or 2\% in 10 years. Our results provide strong, longitudinal evidence of cognitive aging in midlife women, with substantial within-woman declines in processing speed and memory. Further research is needed to identify factors that influence decline rates and to develop interventions that slow cognitive aging.}

FTO demethylates N6-methyladenosine, a potential regulatory RNA modification, but the mechanisms by which FTO predisposes humans to obesity remain unclear. In adiposity-matched, normal-weight humans, we showed that subjects homozygous for the FTO ``obesity-risk'' rs9939609 A allele have dysregulated circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone acyl-ghrelin and attenuated postprandial appetite reduction. Using functional MRI (fMRI) in normal-weight AA and TT humans, we found that the FTO genotype modulates the neural responses to food images in homeostatic and brain reward regions. Furthermore, AA and TT subjects exhibited divergent neural responsiveness to circulating acyl-ghrelin within brain regions that regulate appetite, reward processing, and incentive motivation. In cell models, FTO overexpression reduced ghrelin mRNA N6-methyladenosine methylation, concomitantly increasing ghrelin mRNA and peptide levels. Furthermore, peripheral blood cells from AA human subjects exhibited increased FTO mRNA, reduced ghrelin mRNA N6-methyladenosine methylation, and increased ghrelin mRNA abundance compared with TT subjects. Our findings show that FTO regulates ghrelin, a key mediator of ingestive behavior, and offer insight into how FTO obesity-risk alleles predispose to increased energy intake and obesity in humans.}

  abstract = {Chronic active multiple sclerosis lesions, characterized by a hyperintense rim of iron-enriched, activated microglia and macrophages, have been linked to greater tissue damage. Post-mortem studies have determined that chronic active lesions are primarily related to the later stages of multiple sclerosis; however, the occurrence of these lesions, and their relationship to earlier disease stages may be greatly underestimated. Detection of chronic active lesions across the patient spectrum of multiple sclerosis requires a validated imaging tool to accurately identify lesions with persistent inflammation. Quantitative susceptibility mapping provides efficient in vivo quantification of susceptibility changes related to iron deposition and the potential to identify lesions harbouring iron-laden inflammatory cells. The PET tracer 11C-PK11195 targets the translocator protein expressed by activated microglia and infiltrating macrophages. Accordingly, this study aimed to validate that lesions with a hyperintense rim on quantitative susceptibility mapping from both relapsing and progressive patients demonstrate a higher level of innate immune activation as measured on 11C-PK11195 PET. Thirty patients were enrolled in this study, 24 patients had relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, six had progressive multiple sclerosis, and all patients had concomitant MRI with a gradient echo sequence and PET with 11C-PK11195. A total of 406 chronic lesions were detected, and 43 chronic lesions with a hyperintense rim on quantitative susceptibility mapping were identified as rim+ lesions. Susceptibility (relative to CSF) was higher in rim+ (2.42 {$\pm$} 17.45 ppb) compared to rim- lesions (-14.6 {$\pm$} 19.3 ppb, P \&lt; 0.0001). Among rim+ lesions, susceptibility within the rim (20.04 {$\pm$} 14.28 ppb) was significantly higher compared to the core (-5.49 {$\pm$} 14.44 ppb, P \&lt; 0.0001), consistent with the presence of iron. In a mixed-effects model, 11C-PK11195 uptake, representing activated microglia/macrophages, was higher in rim+ lesions compared to rim- lesions (P = 0.015). Validating our in vivo imaging results, multiple sclerosis brain slabs were imaged with quantitative susceptibility mapping and processed for immunohistochemistry. These results showed a positive translocator protein signal throughout the expansive hyperintense border of rim+ lesions, which co-localized with iron containing CD68+ microglia and macrophages. In conclusion, this study provides evidence that suggests that a hyperintense rim on quantitative susceptibility measure within a chronic lesion is a correlate for persistent inflammatory activity and that these lesions can be identified in the relapsing patients. Utilizing quantitative susceptibility measure to differentiate chronic multiple sclerosis lesion subtypes, especially chronic active lesions, would provide a method to assess the impact of these lesions on disease progression.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: In line with cognitive reserve theory, higher occupational cognitive complexity is associated with reduced cognitive decline in older adulthood. How and when occupational cognitive complexity first exerts protective effects during the life span remains unclear. We investigated associations between occupational cognitive complexity during early to midadulthood and brain structure and cognition in midlife. METHOD: Participants were 669 adults from the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (aged 18-30 years at baseline, 52\% female, 38\% Black). We calculated scores reflecting occupational cognitive complexity using Census Occupation Codes (years 10 and 15) and Occupational Information Network (O*NET) data. At year 25, participants had structural brain magnetic resonance imaging, diffusion tensor imaging, and cognitive testing (Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Stroop). In adjusted mixed models, we examined associations between occupational cognitive complexity during early to midadulthood and midlife brain structure, specifically gray matter volume and white matter fractional anisotropy, and cognition in midlife (all outcomes converted to z-scores). RESULTS: Higher occupational cognitive complexity was associated with greater white matter fractional anisotropy (estimate = 0.10, p = .01) but not gray matter volume. Higher occupational cognitive complexity was associated with better Digit Symbol Substitution Test (estimate = 0.13, p {$<$} .001) and Stroop (estimate = 0.09, p = .01) performance but not Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test performance. CONCLUSIONS: Occupational cognitive complexity earlier in adulthood is associated with better white matter integrity, processing speed, and executive function in midlife. These associations may capture how occupational cognitive complexity contributes to cognitive reserve. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved). FAU - Kaup, Allison R},

Disparities and inequities in rates and treatment of disease stem from a complex web of environmental, sociocultural, behavioral, and biological factors that accumulate over a lifetime to produce population-level differences. As evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, health disparities result in markedly different rates of disease, complications of disease, and access to care and treatment. In the US, Alzheimer disease and related dementias are conditions with profound health disparities, disproportionally affecting many racial/ethnic groups. An identified goal of the 2012 federally mandated National Plan to Address Alzheimer Disease was to redress disparities in Alzheimer disease and dementia. Delineating barriers and trajectories of care, particularly among those with health insurance, is an important step for furthering our understanding of disparities in dementia.},

We investigated the association between cardiovascular risk factors and advanced WMH markers in 155 non-demented older adults (mean age: 71~{$\pm~$}5~years). The association between cardiovascular risk factors and quantitative MRI-based WMH shape and volume markers were examined using linear regression analysis. Presence of hypertension was associated with a more irregular shape of periventricular/confluent WMH (convexity (B (95~\% CI)): -0.12 (-0.22{\textendash}-0.03); concavity index: 0.06 (0.02{\textendash}0.11)), but not with total WMH volume (0.22 (-0.15{\textendash}0.59)). Presence of diabetes was associated with deep WMH volume (0.89 (0.15{\textendash}1.63)). Body mass index or hyperlipidemia showed no association with WMH markers. In conclusion, different cardiovascular risk factors seem to be related to a distinct pattern of WMH shape markers in non-demented older adults.

  abstract = {The nucleus accumbens is a brain region that participates in the control of behaviors related to natural reinforcers, such as ingestion, sexual behavior, incentive and instrumental learning, and that also plays a role in addictive processes. This paper comprises a review of work from our laboratory that focuses on two main research areas: (i) the role of the nucleus accumbens in food motivation, and (ii) its putative functions in cellular plasticity underlying appetitive learning. First, work within a number of different behavioral paradigms has shown that accumbens neurochemical systems play specific and dissociable roles in different aspects of food seeking and food intake, and part of this function depends on integration with the lateral hypothalamus and amygdala. We propose that the nucleus accumbens integrates information related to cognitive, sensory, and emotional processing with hypothalamic mechanisms mediating energy balance. This system as a whole enables complex hierarchical control of adaptive ingestive behavior. Regarding the second research area, our studies examining acquisition of lever-pressing for food in rats have shown that activation of glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, within broadly distributed but interconnected regions (nucleus accumbens core, posterior striatum, prefrontal cortex, basolateral and central amygdala), is critical for such learning to occur. This receptor stimulation triggers intracellular cascades that involve protein phosphorylation and new protein synthesis. It is hypothesized that activity in this distributed network (including D1 receptor activity) computes coincident events and thus enhances the probability that temporally related actions and events (e.g. lever pressing and delivery of reward) become associated. Such basic mechanisms of plasticity within this reinforcement learning network also appear to be profoundly affected in addiction.},

  abstract = {Purpose To develop a fast and stable method for correcting the gibbs-ringing artifact. Methods Gibbs-ringing is a well-known artifact which manifests itself as spurious oscillations in the vicinity of sharp image gradients at tissue boundaries. The origin can be seen in the truncation of k-space during MRI data-acquisition. Correction techniques like Gegenbauer reconstruction or extrapolation methods aim at recovering these missing data. Here, we present a simple and robust method which exploits a different view on the Gibbs-phenomenon: The truncation in k-space can be interpreted as a convolution of the underlying image with a sinc-function. As the image is reconstructed on a discretized grid, the severity of the ringing artifacts depends on how this grid is located with respect to the edge and the oscillation pattern of the function. We propose to reinterpolate the image based on local, subvoxel-shifts to sample the ringing pattern at the zero-crossings of the oscillating sinc-function. Results With the proposed method, the artifact can simply, effectively, and robustly be removed with a minimal amount of image smoothing. Conclusions The robustness of the method suggests it as a suitable candidate for an implementation in the standard image processing pipeline in clinical routine.

Additional evidence suggests risk for pathological brain aging in association with insulin resistance (IR). This study piloted investigation of associations of IR with DMN-hippocampal functional connectivity among postmenopausal women at risk for Alzheimer's disease. Twenty middle-aged women underwent resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects were dichotomized relative to fasting plasma insulin levels (i.e., {$>$} 8 mu IU/mL [n = 10] and {$>$} 8 mu IU/mL [n = 10]), and functional connectivity analysis contrasted their respective blood oxygen level-dependent signal correlation between DMN and hippocampal regions. Higher-insulin women had significantly reduced positive associations between the medial prefrontal cortex and bilateral parahippocampal regions extending to the right hippocampus, and conversely, between the left and right hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. Neuropsychological data (all within normal ranges) also showed significant differences with respect to executive functioning and global intelligence. The results provide further evidence of deleterious effects of IR on the hippocampus and cognition. Further imaging studies of the IR-related perturbations in DMN-hippocampal functional connectivity are needed. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {Background Previous research has demonstrated significant relationships between obesity and brain structure. Both phenotypes are heritable, but it is not known whether they are influenced by common genetic factors. We investigated the genetic etiology of the relationship between individual variability in brain morphology and BMIz using structural MRI in adolescent twins. Method The sample (n\,=\,258) consisted of 54 monozygotic and 75 dizygotic twin pairs (mean(SD) age\,=\,13.61(0.505), BMIz\,=\,0.608(1.013). Brain structure (volume and density of gray and white matter) was assessed using VBM. Significant voxelwise heritability of brain structure was established using the Accelerated Permutation inference for ACE models (APACE) program, with structural heritability varying from 15 to 97\%, depending on region. Bivariate heritability analyses were carried out comparing additive genetic and unique environment models with and without shared genetics on BMIz and the voxels showing significant heritability in the APACE analyses. Results BMIz was positively related to gray matter volume in the brainstem and thalamus and negatively related to gray matter volume in the bilateral uncus and medial orbitofrontal cortex, gray matter density in the cerebellum, prefrontal lobe, temporal lobe, and limbic system, and white matter density in the brainstem. Bivariate heritability analyses showed that BMIz and brain structure share {$\sim$}1/3 of their genes and that {$\sim$}95\% of the phenotypic correlation between BMIz and brain structure is due to shared additive genetic influences. These regions included areas related to decision-making, motivation, liking vs. wanting, taste, interoception, reward processing/learning, caloric evaluation, and inhibition. Conclusion These results suggested genetic factors are responsible for the relationship between BMIz and heritable BMIz related brain structure in areas related to eating behavior.},

  abstract = {A concern for researchers planning multisite studies is that scanner and T1-weighted sequence-related biases on regional volumes could overshadow true effects, especially for studies with a heterogeneous set of scanners and sequences. Current approaches attempt to harmonize data by standardizing hardware, pulse sequences, and protocols, or by calibrating across sites using phantom-based corrections to ensure the same raw image intensities. We propose to avoid harmonization and phantom-based correction entirely. We hypothesized that the bias of estimated regional volumes is scaled between sites due to the contrast and gradient distortion differences between scanners and sequences. Given this assumption, we provide a new statistical framework and derive a power equation to define inclusion criteria for a set of sites based on the variability of their scaling factors. We estimated the scaling factors of 20 scanners with heterogeneous hardware and sequence parameters by scanning a single set of 12 subjects at sites across the United States and Europe. Regional volumes and their scaling factors were estimated for each site using Freesurfer's segmentation algorithm and ordinary least squares, respectively. The scaling factors were validated by comparing the theoretical and simulated power curves, performing a leave-one-out calibration of regional volumes, and evaluating the absolute agreement of all regional volumes between sites before and after calibration. Using our derived power equation, we were able to define the conditions under which harmonization is not necessary to achieve 80\% power. This approach can inform choice of processing pipelines and outcome metrics for multisite studies based on scaling factor variability across sites, enabling collaboration between clinical and research institutions.}

  abstract = {Background: The mechanisms of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) are unclear. Both atherosclerosis and a non-atherosclerotic diffuse arteriopathy have been reported pathologically. Two pathological and radiological subtypes have been suggested: localised atherosclerotic disease in larger perforating arteries causing larger lacunar infarcts without leukoaraiosis, and diffuse disease in smaller arterioles causing multiple smaller lacunar infarcts with leukoaraiosis. If atherosclerosis were important in SVD as a whole or in one particular subtype, one would expect the risk factor profile to be similar to that of cerebral large vessel disease (LVD). Methods: Risk factor profiles were compared in Caucasian stroke patients with SVD (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}414), LVD (n{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}471) and 734 stroke-free Caucasian population controls. Patients with SVD were subdivided according to the presence or absence of confluent leukoaraiosis, into isolated lacunar infarction (ILI) and ischaemic leukoaraiosis (ILA). Results: Hypertension was commoner in SVD than LVD (odds ratio (OR) 3.43 (2.32 to 5.07); p\&amp;lt;0.001) whereas hypercholesterolaemia (OR 0.34 (0.24 to 0.48); p\&amp;lt;0.001), smoking (OR 0.63 (0.44 to 0.91); p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.012), myocardial infarction (OR 0.35 (0.20 to 0.59); p\&amp;lt;0.001) and peripheral vascular disease (OR 0.32 (0.20 to 0.50); p\&amp;lt;0.001) were commoner in LVD. Among SVD patients, age (OR 1.11 (1.09 to 1.14); p\&amp;lt;0.001) and hypertension (OR 3.32 (1.56 to 7.07); p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.002) were associated with ILA and hypercholesterolaemia (OR 0.45 (0.28 to 0.74); p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.002), diabetes (OR 0.42 (0.21 to 0.84); p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.014) and myocardial infarction (OR 0.18 (0.06 to 0.52); p{$\mkern1mu$}={$\mkern1mu$}0.001) with ILI. Conclusion: SVD has a different risk factor profile from the typical atherosclerotic profile found in LVD, with hypertension being important. There are differences in the risk factor profile between the SVD subtypes; the association of ILI with hypercholesterolaemia, diabetes and myocardial infarction may be consistent with a more atherosclerotic aetiology.}

We therefore aimed to determine the effects of common cardiovascular risk factors on vulnerable gray matter (GM) networks in a large and well-characterized population-based cohort. In 616 healthy elderly (258 women, 60-80 years) of the LIFE-Adult-Study, we assessed the effects of obesity, smoking, blood pressure, markers of glucose and lipid metabolism as well as physical activity on major GM-networks derived using linked independent component analysis. Age, sex, hypertension, diabetes, white matter hyperintensities, education and depression were considered as confounders. Results showed that smoking, higher blood pressure, and higher glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) were independently associated with lower GM volume and thickness in GM-networks that covered most areas of the neocortex. Higher waist-to-hip ratio was independently associated with lower GM volume in a network of multimodal regions that correlated negatively with age and memory performance. In this large cross-sectional study, we found selective negative associations of smoking, higher blood pressure, higher glucose, and visceral obesity with structural covariance networks, suggesting that reducing these factors could help to delay late-life trajectories of GM aging.},

A higher BMI correlated significantly with lower GMV in multiple brain regions, including (pre)frontal, temporal, insular and occipital cortex, thalamus, putamen, amygdala, and cerebellum, even after adjusting for confounders. In addition, lower GMV in prefrontal and thalamic areas partially mediated negative effects of (1) higher BMI and (2) higher age on memory performance. We here showed that a higher BMI in older adults is associated with widespread gray matter alterations, irrespective of obesity-related comorbidities and other confounders. Our results further indicate that a higher BMI induces structural alterations that translate into subtle impairments in memory performance in aging.},

However, differential roles of WMH by region in cognitive function are still unclear. The aim of this study was to ascertain the differential role of regional WMH in predicting progression from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to different subtypes of dementia.Methods:Participants were recruited from the Clinical Research Center for Dementia of South Korea (CREDOS) study. A total of 622 participants with MCI diagnoses at baseline and follow-up evaluations were included for the analysis. Initial MRI scans were rated for WMH on a visual rating scale developed for the CREDOS. Differential effects of regional WMH in predicting incident dementia were evaluated using the Cox proportional hazards model.Results:Of the 622 participants with MCI at baseline, 139 patients (22.3\%) converted to all-cause dementia over a median of 14.3 (range 6.0{\textendash}36.5) months. Severe periventricular WMH (PWMH) predicted incident all-cause dementia (Hazard ratio (HR) 2.22; 95\% confidence interval (CI) 1.43{\textendash}3.43) and Alzheimer's disease (AD) (HR 1.86; 95\% CI 1.12{\textendash}3.07). Subcortical vascular dementia (SVD) was predicted by both PWMH (HR 16.14; 95\% CI 1.97{\textendash}132.06) and DWMH (HR 8.77; 95\% CI 1.77{\textendash}43.49) in more severe form ({$\geq$} 10 mm).Conclusions:WMH differentially predict dementia by region and severity. Our findings suggest that PWMH may play an independent role in the pathogenesis of dementia, especially in AD.},

However, little is known about the effect of body mass index and clustering of vascular risk factors on the development of dementia. Objective: To investigate the relation between midlife body mass index and clustering of vascular risk factors and subsequent dementia and AD. Design and Setting: Participants of the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging, and Dementia (CAIDE) study were derived from random, population-based samples previously studied in a survey carried out in 1972, 1977, 1982, or 1987. After an average follow-up of 21 years, 1449 individuals (73\%) aged 65 to 79 years participated in the reexamination in 1998. Main Outcome Measures: Dementia and AD. Results: Obesity at midlife (body mass index {$>$} 30 kg/m(2)) was associated with the risk of dementia and AD even after adjusting for sociodemographic variables (odds ratio [OR], 2.4 [95\% confidence interval (CI), 1.2-5.1]). The association was somewhat modified by further adjusting for midlife blood pressure, total cholesterol level, and smoking (OR, 2.1 [95\% CI, 1.0-4.6]) and also for apolipoprotein E genotype and history of vascular disorders (OR, 1.9 [95\% CI, 0.8-4.6]). Midlife obesity, high total cholesterol level, and high systolic blood pressure were all significant risk factors for dementia with ORs of around 2 for each factor, and they increased the risk additively (OR, 6.2 for the combination). Conclusions: Obesity at midlife is associated with an increased risk of dementia and AD later in life. Clustering of vascular risk factors increases the risk in an additive manner. The role of weight reduction for the prevention of dementia needs to be further investigated.},

  abstract = {Summary Background Several vascular risk factors are associated with dementia. We sought to develop a simple method for the prediction of the risk of late-life dementia in people of middle age on the basis of their risk profiles. Methods Data were used from the population-based CAIDE study, which included 1409 individuals who were studied in midlife and re-examined 20 years later for signs of dementia. Several midlife vascular risk factors were studied to create the scoring tool. The score values were estimated on the basis of {$\beta$} coefficients and the dementia risk score was the sum of these individual scores (range 0{\textendash}15). Findings Occurrence of dementia during the 20 years of follow-up was 4\%. Future dementia was significantly predicted by high age ({$\geq$}47 years), low education ({$<$}10 years), hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and obesity. The dementia risk score predicted dementia well (area under curve 0{$\cdot$}77; 95\% CI 0{$\cdot$}71{\textendash}0{$\cdot$}83). The risk of dementia according to the categories of the dementia risk score was 1{$\cdot$}0\% for those with a score of 0{\textendash}5, 1{$\cdot$}9\% for a score of 6{\textendash}7, 4{$\cdot$}2\% for a score of 8{\textendash}9, 7{$\cdot$}4\% for a score of 10{\textendash}11, and 16{$\cdot$}4\% for a score of 12{\textendash}15. When the cut-off of 9 points or more was applied the sensitivity was 0{$\cdot$}77, the specificity was 0{$\cdot$}63, and the negative predictive value was 0{$\cdot$}98. Interpretation The dementia risk score is a novel approach for the prediction of dementia risk, but should be validated and further improved to increase its predictive value. This approach highlights the role of vascular factors in the development of dementia and could help to identify individuals who might benefit from intensive lifestyle consultations and pharmacological interventions.}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether severity and progression of periventricular and deep white matter lesions (WML) and lacunar infarcts were associated with progression of brain atrophy. METHODS: Within the SMART-MR study, a prospective cohort on MRI changes in patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, 565 patients (57 +/- 9 years) without large infarcts had vascular screening and 1.5 T MRI at baseline and after a mean follow-up of 3.9 years. With automated brain segmentation, total brain, cortical gray matter, ventricular, and WML volumes were estimated and expressed relative to intracranial volume (\%). Lacunar infarcts were rated manually. RESULTS: Using linear regression analyses adjusted for demographics and vascular risk factors, periventricular WML volume at baseline was associated with greater decrease in cortical gray matter volume (B = -1.73\%, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -3.15\% to -0.30\%, per 1\% WML volume increase) and greater increase in ventricular volume (B = 0.12\%, 95\% CI 0.04\% to 0.20\%). Progression of periventricular WML volume corresponded with a greater decrease in cortical gray matter volume (B = -0.45\%, 95\% CI -0.9\% to 0\%) and greater increase in ventricular volume (B = 0.15\%, 95\% CI 0.1\% to 0.2\%). Presence of lacunar infarcts was associated with greater decline in total brain volume (B = -0.25\%, 95\% CI -0.49\% to -0.01\%) and progression of lacunar infarcts with a greater decrease of total brain (B = -0.30\%, 95\% CI -0.59\% to 0.01\%) and cortical gray matter volume (B = -0.81\%, 95\% CI -1.43\% to -0.20\%). CONCLUSIONS: In patients with symptomatic atherosclerotic disease, presence and progression of periventricular WML and lacunar infarcts is associated with greater progression of brain atrophy independent of vascular risk factors.},

Studies that were included (1) used MRI; (2) had a population-based or case-control design with a healthy control group that could be used for analysis; (3) matched/adjusted for age, sex, and education; and (4) addressed {$\geq$}1 predefined cognitive domains with {$\geq$}1 validated neuropsychological tests. Data were independently extracted by 2 investigators. Pearson r was extracted/calculated and used as the common metric for the effect size across studies.Results: Twenty-three cross-sectional and 14 longitudinal studies were included with a total of 8,685 and 7,731 participants. Presence of WMHs was significantly associated with concurrent cognitive deficits in all examined domains: general intelligence (Fisher z -0.10, 95\% confidence interval [CI] -0.19 to -0.04), memory (-0.08, -0.13 to -0.06), processing speed (-0.11, -0.17 to -0.07), attention and executive functions (-0.11, -0.16 to -0.07), and perception/construction (-0.15, -0.21 to -0.07). Similar effect sizes were observed for cognitive decline over time. WMH progression was associated with greater cognitive decline, particularly for general intelligence (Fisher z -0.31, 95\% CI -0.5 to -0.02) and attention and executive functions (-0.32, -0.34 to -0.28).Conclusions: The small but robust and consistent effects of WMHs on all cognitive domains suggest a more global effect on cognition than previously thought. Progression of WMHs was associated with even worse cognitive functioning, most pronounced in attention and executive functioning.CI=confidence interval; WMH=white matter hyperintensity}

The present study aimed to address this gap by examining the effect of a Mediterranean dietary pattern (MedDiet) for six months on aspects of cognitive function in a randomised controlled intervention trial (the MedLey study) that extended for a duration of 18 months. In the final analysed cohort, a total of 137 men and women (mean age of 72.1 {$\pm$} 5.0 years) randomly assigned to either a MedDiet or control diet (HabDiet) (i.e., habitual dietary intake), were assessed on a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery, including 11 individual tests. In multivariable-adjusted models, the MedDiet group did not perform significantly better than the HabDiet control group for executive functioning (adjusted mean differences: +2.53, 95\% CI -2.59 to 7.65, p = 0.33); speed of processing (adjusted mean differences: +3.24, 95\% CI -1.21 to 7.70, p = 0.15); memory (adjusted mean differences: +2.00, 95\% CI -3.88 to 7.88, p = 0.50); visual-spatial ability (adjusted mean differences: +0.21, 95\% CI -0.38 to 0.81, 0.48); and overall age-related cognitive performance (adjusted mean differences: +7.99, 95\% CI -4.00 to 19.9, p = 0.19).

The authors defined dementia using the criteria of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV). Each case was individually matched by age ({$\pm$}1 year) and sex to a person drawn randomly from the same population, and free from dementia in the index year (year of onset of dementia in the matched case). Weights were abstracted from the medical records in the system.Results: There were no differences in weight between cases and controls 21 to 30 years prior to the onset of dementia. However, women with dementia had lower weight than controls starting at 11 to 20 years prior to the index year, and the difference increased over time through the index year. We found a trend of increasing risk of dementia with decreasing weight in women both at the index year (test for linear trend; p {$<$} 0.001) and 9 to 10 years before the index year (test for linear trend; p = 0.001).Conclusions: Even accounting for delays in diagnosis, weight loss precedes the diagnosis of dementia in women but not in men by several years. This loss may relate to predementia apathy, loss of initiative, and reduced olfactory function.}

Here, we aimed to investigate if these beneficial effects extend to individuals at high-risk for dementia, i. e., patients with mild cognitive impairment. In a randomized, double-blind interventional study, forty well-characterized patients with mild cognitive impairment (21 females; 50-80 years) completed 26 weeks of resveratrol (200mg/d; n=18) or placebo (1015mg/d olive oil; n=22) intake. Serum levels of glucose, glycated hemoglobin A1c and insulin were determined before and after intervention. Moreover, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (3T) (n=14 vs 16) was conducted to analyze hippocampus volume, microstructure and resting-state functional connectivity, and neuropsychological testing was conducted to assess learning and memory (primary endpoint) at both time points. In comparison to the control group, resveratrol supplementation resulted in lower glycated hemoglobin A1c concentration with a moderate effect size (ANOVARM p=0.059, Cohen{\textasciiacute}s d=0.66), higher resting-state functional connectivity between right anterior hippocampus and right angular cortex (p{$<$}0.001), and led to a moderate preservation of left anterior hippocampus volume (ANOVARM p=0.061, Cohen{\textasciiacute}s d= 0.68). No significant differences in memory performance emerged between groups. This proof-of-concept study indicates for the first-time that resveratrol intake may reduce glycated hemoglobin A1c, preserves hippocampus volume, and improves hippocampus resting-state functional connectivity in at-risk patients for dementia. Larger trials with longer intervention time should now determine if these benefits can be validated and extended to cognitive function.}

Methods: The author reviewed literature published through July 2005 from electronic MEDLINE, PubMed, and hand searches. CMB prevalence analyses were performed for subjects without cerebrovascular disease, with ICH, and with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Results: Prevalence data from more than 5,200 subjects were analyzed. In elderly subjects without cerebrovascular disease, CMB prevalence is between 5\% and 6\%, associated with advanced age, while data are inconsistent with regard to CMB and chronic hypertension. CMB are prevalent in 68\% of patients with spontaneous ICH and 40\% of those with ischemic cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral microangiopathy (lacunes, leukoaraiosis) is associated with the highest prevalence (57\%) of CMB among patients with ischemic stroke. In patients with suspected cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) or Alzheimer disease, CMB are predominantly located in the cortical-subcortical area. Current data provide no evidence that CMB increase the risk of ICH among patients on antithrombotic treatment or those treated with thrombolysis for acute stroke. Conclusions: Cerebral microbleeds might indicate a higher risk of future intracerebral hemorrhage and may be a marker of cerebral small-vessel disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. However, more prospective data are required in order to confirm these assumptions. Recommendations to guide antithrombotic treatment based on the detection of cerebral microbleeds are presently not justified.}

For example, differences in MRI measures (e.g., network strength, white matter integrity) between patient and control groups may be due to the differences in their head motion. To determine whether head motion is an important variable in itself, or just simply a confounding variable, we explored individual differences in psychological traits that may predispose some people to move more than others during an MRI scan. In the first two studies, we demonstrated in both children (N = 245) and adults (N = 581) that head motion, estimated from resting-state functional MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, was reliably correlated with impulsivity scores. Further, the difference in head motion between children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and typically developing children was largely due to differences in impulsivity. Finally, in the third study, we confirmed the observation that the regression approach, which aims to deal with motion issues by regressing out motion in the group analysis, would underestimate the effect of interest. Taken together, the present findings provide empirical evidence that links in-scanner head motion to psychological traits.},

  abstract = {Background White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are a major risk factor for stroke and dementia, but their pathogenesis is incompletely understood. It has been debated how much risk is accounted for by conventional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRFs), and this has major implications as to how effective a preventative strategy targeting these risk factors will be. Methods and Results We included 41\,626 UK Biobank participants (47.2\% men), with a mean age of 55\,years (SD, 7.5\,years), who underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging at the first imaging assessment beginning in 2014. The relationships among CVRFs, cardiovascular conditions, and WMH volume as a percentage of total brain volume were examined using correlations and structural equation models. Only 32\% of the variance in WMH volume was explained by measures of CVRFs, sex, and age, of which age accounted for 16\%. CVRFs combined accounted for {$\approx$}15\% of the variance. However, a large portion of the variance (well over 60\%) remains unexplained. Of the individual CVRFs, blood pressure parameters together accounted for {$\approx$}10.5\% of the total variance (diagnosis of hypertension, 4.4\%; systolic blood pressure, 4.4\%; and diastolic blood pressure, 1.7\%). The variance explained by most individual CVRFs declined with age. Conclusions Our findings suggest the presence of other vascular and nonvascular factors underlying the development of WMHs. Although they emphasize the importance of modification of conventional CVRFs, particularly hypertension, they highlight the need to better understand risk factors underlying the considerable unexplained variance in WMHs if we are to develop better preventative approaches.},

In the present study we examined the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) of 57 obese human subjects and 54 age- and sex- matched non-obese controls by MRI and analyzed the T2-hyperintensity as a measure of HI. Obese subjects exhibited T2-hyperintensity in the left but not the right MBH which was strongly associated with systemic low-grade inflammation. MRI-spectroscopy revealed the number of neurons in the left hypothalamic region to be similar in obese versus control subjects suggesting functional but not structural impairment due to the inflammatory process. To gain mechanistic insights we performed nutritional analysis and 16S rDNA microbiome sequencing which showed that high-fat diet induces reduction of Parasutterella sp. in the gut, which is significantly correlated to MBH-T2-hyperintensity. In addition to these environmental factors we found subjects carrying common polymorphisms in the JNK or the MC4R gene to be more susceptible to HI. Finally, in a subgroup analysis bariatric surgery had no effect on MBH-T2-hyperintensity despite inducing significant weight loss and improvement of peripheral insulin sensitivity. In conclusion, obesity in humans is associated with HI and disturbances in the gut-brain axis which are influenced by both environmental and genetic factors.}

  abstract = {There is a well-established literature linking obesity to altered dopamine signaling and brain response to food-related stimuli. Neuroimaging studies frequently report enhanced responses in dopaminergic regions during food anticipation and decreased responses during reward receipt. This has been interpreted as reflecting anticipatory ``reward surfeit'', and consummatory ``reward deficiency''. In particular, attenuated response in the dorsal striatum to primary food rewards is proposed to reflect anhedonia, which leads to overeating in an attempt to compensate for the reward deficit. In this paper, we propose an alternative view. We consider brain response to food-related stimuli in a reinforcement-learning framework, which can be employed to separate the contributions of reward sensitivity and reward-related learning that are typically entangled in the brain response to reward. Consequently, we posit that decreased striatal responses to milkshake receipt reflect reduced reward-related learning rather than reward deficiency or anhedonia because reduced reward sensitivity would translate uniformly into reduced anticipatory and consummatory responses to reward. By re-conceptualizing reward deficiency as a shift in learning about subjective value of rewards, we attempt to reconcile neuroimaging findings with the putative role of dopamine in effort, energy expenditure and exploration and suggest that attenuated brain responses to energy dense foods reflect the ``fuel'', not the fun entailed by the reward.},

Both the obese and the randomly selected men were found to have the largest adipose tissue thickness in the abdominal region. Women, however, showed a relative preponderance for the gluteal and femoral regions. FCW increased with expanding body fat up to a maximal size of approximately 0.7-0.8 micrograms/cell in each region. After this increase in FCW, a more rapid increase in FCN was found. For the same degree of relative overweight, men had higher triglyceride, fasting glucose, and insulin levels; higher sums of glucose and insulin levels during an oral glucose tolerance test; and higher blood pressure. Furthermore, elevated fasting glucose levels (greater than 7.4 mM) occurred twice as often in the males. These differences between males and females persisted even after body fat matching. A male risk profile was seen in women characterized by abdominal obesity (high waist/hip circumference ratio) as compared to women with the typical peripheral obesity. Stepwise multiple regression analyses in both women and men showed the obesity complications to be associated in a first step to waist/hip circumference or body fat and in a second to abdominal fat cell size. It may thus be concluded that: (a) In both obese and nonobese subjects, regional differences exist between the sexes with regard to adipose tissue distribution. (b) Moderate expansion of body fat is mainly due to FCW enlargement, which is subsequently followed by increased FCN. (c) Men and women with a male abdominal type of obesity are more susceptible to the effect of excess body fat on lipid and carbohydrate metabolism.},

Methods A cohort of 80 women (mean age 40{$\pm$}10 years) who underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass between 1997 and 2002 were followed in a Swiss University Hospital for an average of 8{$\pm$}1.2 years. The primary outcome was successful weight loss defined as excess weight loss {$\geq$}50\%. Body composition was measured by bioelectrical analysis, and diet was assessed via a food diary. Eating disorders, psychological factors, and quality of life were evaluated by questionnaires. Patients' perceptions of difficulties and benefits were explored using semistructured interviewing. Results at baseline and last visit were compared using paired t test. Cofactors' means were compared between successful and unsuccessful patients with Student t tests and logistic regression. Results Average weight loss 8 years after surgery was 30.7{$\pm$}13.8 kg. Excess weight loss {$\geq$}50\% was observed for 47 patients (59\%). Between baseline and last visit, relative proportions of fat mass/total body weight decreased, and fat-free mass/total body weight increased. Mean energy intake was 2,355{$\pm$}775 kcal at baseline and 1,680{$\pm$}506 kcal at last visit, with 42\% of energy from carbohydrates, 39\% of energy from fats, and 19\% of energy from protein (0.8 g/kg). At last visit, 41 patients (51\%) described episodes of binge eating or night eating syndrome. Factors associated with excess weight loss {$\geq$}50\% were: younger age at operation, greater number of psychological consultations before the operation, and higher scores on ineffectiveness and social insecurity scales at baseline. Conclusions More than half of the patients achieved successful weight loss, but disordered eating behavior was frequent. Periodic follow-up screenings and interdisciplinary care are advised. The definition of successful outcome should take into account problematic eating behaviors.}

  abstract = {Objective There is evidence that executive function, and specifically inhibitory control, is related to obesity and eating behavior. The goal of this study was to determine whether personality traits and inhibitory control predict weight loss after bariatric procedures. Although the impressive weight reduction after bariatric surgery has been shown in short- and medium-term studies, the effect of personality traits on this reduction is uncertain. Specifically, the effect of impulsivity is still largely unknown. Setting Patients attending either a multidisciplinary information session or outpatient clinic at the Imperial Weight Management Centre were recruited with informed consent into the trial over a 4-month period from January to April 2013. Participants were invited to attend behavioral testing on an outpatient basis in a silent room invigilated by a single researcher. Methods Forty-five bariatric patients participated in the study (25 patients had a gastric bypass, with a mean BMI of 41.8 and age of 39.0 years; 20 had a sleeve gastrectomy, with a mean BMI of 47.2 and age of 49.0 years). All patients completed personality measures of impulsivity{\textemdash}Barratt's Impulsivity Scale, as well as behavioral measures of impulsivity{\textemdash}the stop-signal reaction-time (SSRT) task measuring inhibitory control and the temporal discounting task measuring reward processing. Those measures were examined in relation to weight loss 6 months after surgery. Results The surgical procedure and changes in the behavioral measure of inhibitory control (SSRT) were found to be significant predictors of reduction in body mass index (BMI) in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The sleeve gastrectomy group found a reduction in BMI of 14.1\%, which was significantly less than the 25\% reduction in BMI in the gastric bypass group. The direction (parameter estimate) of the significant effect was positive for SSRT change, which indicates that pre- and postreduction in impulsivity predicts reduction in BMI. Conclusion Impulsivity measures predict weight reduction in patients undergoing bariatric surgery. This result has implications for predicting outcomes from surgical treatments of obesity.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a key risk factor for the development of insulin resistance, Type 2 diabetes and associated diseases; thus, it has become a major public health concern. In this context, a detailed understanding of brain networks regulating food intake, including hormonal modulation, is crucial. At present, little is known about potential alterations of cerebral networks regulating ingestive behavior. We used "resting state" functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the functional connectivity integrity of resting state networks (RSNs) related to food intake in lean and obese subjects using independent component analysis. Our results showed altered functional connectivity strength in obese compared to lean subjects in the default mode network (DMN) and temporal lobe network. In the DMN, obese subjects showed in the precuneus bilaterally increased and in the right anterior cingulate decreased functional connectivity strength. Furthermore, in the temporal lobe network, obese subjects showed decreased functional connectivity strength in the left insular cortex. The functional connectivity magnitude significantly correlated with body mass index (BMI). Two further RSNs, including brain regions associated with food and reward processing, did not show BMI, but insulin associated functional connectivity strength. Here, the left orbitofrontal cortex and right putamen functional connectivity strength was positively correlated with fasting insulin levels and negatively correlated with insulin sensitivity index. Taken together, these results complement and expand previous functional neuroimaging findings by demonstrating that obesity and insulin levels influence brain function during rest in networks supporting reward and food regulation.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Impaired brain insulin action has been linked to obesity, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. To date, the central nervous effects of insulin in obese humans still remain ill defined, and no study thus far has evaluated the specific brain areas affected by insulin resistance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In 25 healthy lean and 23 overweight/obese participants, we performed magnetic resonance imaging to measure cerebral blood flow (CBF) before and 15 and 30 min after application of intranasal insulin or placebo. Additionally, participants explicitly rated pictures of high-caloric savory and sweet food 60 min after the spray for wanting and liking. RESULTS: In response to insulin compared with placebo, we found a significant CBF decrease in the hypothalamus in both lean and overweight/obese participants. The magnitude of this response correlated with visceral adipose tissue independent of other fat compartments. Furthermore, we observed a differential response in the lean compared with the overweight/obese group in the prefrontal cortex, resulting in an insulin-induced CBF reduction in lean participants only. This prefrontal cortex response significantly correlated with peripheral insulin sensitivity and eating behavior measures such as disinhibition and food craving. Behaviorally, we were able to observe a significant reduction for the wanting of sweet foods after insulin application in lean men only. CONCLUSIONS: Brain insulin action was selectively impaired in the prefrontal cortex in overweight and obese adults and in the hypothalamus in participants with high visceral adipose tissue, potentially promoting an altered homeostatic set point and reduced inhibitory control contributing to overeating behavior.},

  abstract = {Hypertension is an important cause of cerebral small vessel disease, especially of white matter hyperintensity (WMH). The ability of intensive blood pressure (BP) control in preventing this pathological progression remains unclear. The authors systematically searched PubMed, EMBASE, SCOPUS, and Cochrane library for publications until July 20, 2020. Studies included were clinical trials with random allocation to an antihypertensive medication against placebo, or different treatment targets. The primary outcome was intergroup differences in the change of WMH volume. A random-effect model was applied for pooling effect measures. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression were conducted to explore heterogeneity. Seven studies with 2693 patients were identified. Compared with the control group, patients in the intensive BP control group had a slower progression of WMH, with a pooled intergroup standard mean difference (SMD) for WMH change of -0.22 (95\% CI: -0.35~{\textasciitilde}~-0.09, I2~=~63\%). For studies comparing intensive and standard BP target, the pooled SMD is -0.37 (95\% CI:-0.50{\textasciitilde}-0.24, I2~=~0\%), while the pooled SMD of studies comparing active antihypertensive medication and placebo was only -0.08 (95\% CI: -0.17~{\textasciitilde}~0.01, I2~=~0\%). Meta-regression analysis showed that the reduction in WMH progression is proportional to the magnitude of intensive BP control ({$\beta~$}=~-0.028, P~{$<~$}.001). In conclusion, intensive BP control prevents WMH progression, and its effect is associated with the magnitude of intensive BP control.},

  abstract = {The default mode network (DMN) comprises a set of regions that exhibit ongoing, intrinsic activity in the resting state and task-related decreases in activity across a range of paradigms. However, DMN regions have also been reported as task-related increases, either independently or coactivated with other regions in the network. Cognitive subtractions and the use of low-level baseline conditions have generally masked the functional nature of these regions. Using a combination of activation likelihood estimation, which assesses statistically significant convergence of neuroimaging results, and tools distributed with the BrainMap database, we identified core regions in the DMN and examined their functional heterogeneity. Meta-analytic coactivation maps of task-related increases were independently generated for each region, which included both within-DMN and non-DMN connections. Their functional properties were assessed using behavioral domain metadata in BrainMap. These results were integrated to determine a DMN connectivity model that represents the patterns of interactions observed in task-related increases in activity across diverse tasks. Subnetwork components of this model were identified, and behavioral domain analysis of these cliques yielded discrete functional properties, demonstrating that components of the DMN are differentially specialized. Affective and perceptual cliques of the DMN were identified, as well as the cliques associated with a reduced preference for motor processing. In summary, we used advanced coordinate-based meta-analysis techniques to explicate behavior and connectivity in the default mode network; future work will involve applying this analysis strategy to other modes of brain function, such as executive function or sensorimotor systems.}

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is a heterogeneous group of pathological disorders that affect the small vessels of the brain and are an important cause of cognitive impairment. The ischaemic consequences of this disease can be detected using MRI, and include white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunar infarcts and microhaemorrhages. The relationship between SVD disease severity, as defined by WMH volume, in sporadic age-related SVD and cortical thickness has not been well defined. However, regional cortical thickness change would be expected due to associated phenomena such as underlying ischaemic white matter damage, and the observation that widespread cortical thinning is observed in the related genetic condition CADASIL (Righart et al., 2013). Using MRI data, we have developed a semi-automated processing pipeline for the anatomical analysis of individuals with cerebral small vessel disease and applied it cross-sectionally to 121 subjects diagnosed with this condition. Using a novel combined automated white matter lesion segmentation algorithm and lesion repair step, highly accurate warping to a group average template was achieved. The volume of white matter affected by WMH was calculated, and used as a covariate of interest in a voxel-based morphometry and voxel-based cortical thickness analysis. Additionally, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) was used to assess if the severity of SVD, measured by WMH volume, could be predicted from the morphometry and cortical thickness measures. We found significant (Family Wise Error corrected p {$<$} 0.05) volumetric decline with increasing lesion load predominately in the parietal lobes, anterior insula and caudate nuclei bilaterally. Widespread significant cortical thinning was found bilaterally in the dorsolateral prefrontal, parietal and posterio-superior temporal cortices. These represent distinctive patterns of cortical thinning and volumetric reduction compared to ageing effects in the same cohort, which exhibited greater changes in the occipital and sensorimotor cortices. Using GPR, the absolute WMH volume could be significantly estimated from the grey matter density and cortical thickness maps (Pearson's coefficients 0.80 and 0.75 respectively). We demonstrate that SVD severity is associated with regional cortical thinning. Furthermore a quantitative measure of SVD severity (WMH volume) can be predicted from grey matter measures, supporting an association between white and grey matter damage. The pattern of cortical thinning and volumetric decline is distinctive for SVD severity compared to ageing. These results, taken together, suggest that there is a phenotypic pattern of atrophy associated with SVD severity.},

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease is a common condition associated with lacunar stroke, cognitive impairment and significant functional morbidity. White matter hyperintensities and brain atrophy, seen on magnetic resonance imaging, are correlated with increasing disease severity. However, how the two are related remains an open question. To better define the relationship between white matter hyperintensity growth and brain atrophy, we applied a semi-automated magnetic resonance imaging segmentation analysis pipeline to a 3-year longitudinal cohort of 99 subjects with symptomatic small vessel disease, who were followed-up for {$>$}/=1 years. Using a novel two-stage warping pipeline with tissue repair step, voxel-by-voxel rate of change maps were calculated for each tissue class (grey matter, white matter, white matter hyperintensities and lacunes) for each individual. These maps capture both the distribution of disease and spatial information showing local rates of growth and atrophy. These were analysed to answer three primary questions: first, is there a relationship between whole brain atrophy and magnetic resonance imaging markers of small vessel disease (white matter hyperintensities or lacune volume)? Second, is there regional variation within the cerebral white matter in the rate of white matter hyperintensity progression? Finally, are there regionally specific relationships between the rates of white matter hyperintensity progression and cortical grey matter atrophy? We demonstrate that the rates of white matter hyperintensity expansion and grey matter atrophy are strongly correlated (Pearson's R = -0.69, P {$<$} 1 x 10(-7)), and significant grey matter loss and whole brain atrophy occurs annually (P {$<$} 0.05). Additionally, the rate of white matter hyperintensity growth was heterogeneous, occurring more rapidly within long association fasciculi. Using voxel-based quantification (family-wise error corrected P {$<$} 0.05), we show the rate of white matter hyperintensity progression is associated with increases in cortical grey matter atrophy rates, in the medial-frontal, orbito-frontal, parietal and occipital regions. Conversely, increased rates of global grey matter atrophy are significantly associated with faster white matter hyperintensity growth in the frontal and parietal regions. Together, these results link the progression of white matter hyperintensities with increasing rates of regional grey matter atrophy, and demonstrate that grey matter atrophy is the major contributor to whole brain atrophy in symptomatic cerebral small vessel disease. These measures provide novel insights into the longitudinal pathogenesis of small vessel disease, and imply that therapies aimed at reducing progression of white matter hyperintensities via end-arteriole damage may protect against secondary brain atrophy and consequent functional morbidity.},

Lesion location influenced their effect on cognition and behavior: Frontal WMH in the proximity of the frontal ventricles mainly affected executive function and parieto-temporal WMH in the proximity of the posterior horns deteriorated memory, while WMH in the upper deep white matter?including the corticospinal tract?compromised motor speed performance. This study exposes the subtle and subclinical yet detrimental effects of WMH on cognition in healthy elderly, and strongly suggests a causal influence of WMH on cognition by demonstrating the spatial specificity of these effects.}

Methods Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body mass index (BMI), systolic/diastolic blood pressure, hypertension, diabetes and smoking status, blood glucose and inflammatory markers, as well as distribution of WMH were assessed in 1,825 participants of the LIFE-adult study (age, 20?82 years; BMI, 18.4?55.4 kg/m2) using high-resolution 3-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging. Voxel-wise analyses tested if obesity predicts regional probability of WMH. Additionally, mediation effects of high-sensitive C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 (IL6) measured in blood were related to obesity and WMH using linear regression and structural equation models. Results WHR related to higher WMH probability predominantly in the deep white matter, even after adjusting for effects of age, sex, and systolic blood pressure (mean {\ss} = 0.0043 [0.0008 SE], 95\% confidence interval, [0.00427, 0.0043]; threshold-free cluster enhancement, family-wise error-corrected p {$<$} 0.05). Conversely, higher systolic blood pressure was associated with WMH in periventricular white matter regions. Mediation analyses indicated that both higher WHR and higher BMI contributed to increased deep-to-periventricular WMH ratio through elevated IL6. Interpretation Our results indicate an increased WMH burden selectively in the deep white matter in obese subjects with high visceral fat accumulation, independent of common obesity comorbidities such as hypertension. Mediation analyses proposed that visceral obesity contributes to deep white matter lesions through increases in proinflammatory cytokines, suggesting a pathomechanistic link. Longitudinal studies need to confirm this hypothesis. ANN NEUROL 2019;85:194?203.}

  abstract = {Importance~ The aging of the US population is expected to lead to a large increase in the number of adults with dementia, but some recent studies in the United States and other high-income countries suggest that the age-specific risk of dementia may have declined over the past 25 years. Clarifying current and future population trends in dementia prevalence and risk has important implications for patients, families, and government programs.Objective~ To compare the prevalence of dementia in the United States in 2000 and 2012.Design, Setting, and Participants~ We used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative, population-based longitudinal survey of individuals in the United States 65 years or older from the 2000 (n\,=\,10\,546) and 2012 (n\,=\,10\,511) waves of the HRS.Main Outcomes and Measures~ Dementia was identified in each year using HRS cognitive measures and validated methods for classifying self-respondents, as well as those represented by a proxy. Logistic regression was used to identify socioeconomic and health variables associated with change in dementia prevalence between 2000 and 2012.Results~ The study cohorts had an average age of 75.0 years (95\% CI, 74.8-75.2 years) in 2000 and 74.8 years (95\% CI, 74.5-75.1 years) in 2012 (P\,=\,.24); 58.4\% (95\% CI, 57.3\%-59.4\%) of the 2000 cohort was female compared with 56.3\% (95\% CI, 55.5\%-57.0\%) of the 2012 cohort (P\,\&lt;\,.001). Dementia prevalence among those 65 years or older decreased from 11.6\% (95\% CI, 10.7\%-12.7\%) in 2000 to 8.8\% (95\% CI, 8.2\%-9.4\%) (8.6\% with age- and sex-standardization) in 2012 (P\,\&lt;\,.001). More years of education was associated with a lower risk for dementia, and average years of education increased significantly (from 11.8 years [95\% CI, 11.6-11.9 years] to 12.7 years [95\% CI, 12.6-12.9 years]; P\,\&lt;\,.001) between 2000 and 2012. The decline in dementia prevalence occurred even though there was a significant age- and sex-adjusted increase between years in the cardiovascular risk profile (eg, prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, and obesity) among older US adults.Conclusions and Relevance~ The prevalence of dementia in the United States declined significantly between 2000 and 2012. An increase in educational attainment was associated with some of the decline in dementia prevalence, but the full set of social, behavioral, and medical factors contributing to the decline is still uncertain. Continued monitoring of trends in dementia incidence and prevalence will be important for better gauging the full future societal impact of dementia as the number of older adults increases in the decades ahead.}

  abstract = {The relationship between obesity and insulin resistance, while well recognized for many years, has nonetheless been confusing since not all obese individuals have insulin resistance (1) and because insulin resistance occurs in individuals who have BMIs that are within the normal or mildly overweight categories (2).Early attempts to understand the relationships between obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease focused on the waist-to-hip ratio as a means of distinguishing those individuals who were at increased risk from those who were not (3,4). A high waist-to-hip ratio is a surrogate for masculine distribution of obesity (central obesity). Cross-sectional studies by Kissebah et al. (5) and Krotkiewski et al. (6) in the 1980s demonstrated that hypertension, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperinsulinemia, and glucose intolerance were increased in subjects with a high waist-to-hip ratio. Long-term longitudinal population-based studies of men (13.5 years) and women (12 years) in Gothenburg, Sweden, showed that the waist-to-hip ratio was a predictor of the future development of diabetes, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, stroke, and death independent of BMI (3,4).Technology developed in the 1990s, including computer tomography scans and MRI, made it possible to precisely measure specific adipose tissue depots such as total body adipose tissue mass, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue mass, visceral adipose tissue mass, and hepatic and intramuscular triglyceride content (7,8). Utilizing those techniques, many studies have examined the relationship between total adipose tissue, abdominal subcutaneous adipose tissue, and visceral adipose tissue mass and insulin resistance, the components of the metabolic syndrome, and the development of type 2 diabetes or clinical cardiovascular events (9{\textendash}21).Despite the much smaller size of the visceral adipose tissue depot compared with the total subcutaneous adipose tissue depot or total adiposity, many investigations demonstrated that the visceral adipose tissue mass and not {\dots}}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are areas of increased signal on T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans that most commonly reflect small vessel cerebrovascular disease. Increased WMH volume is associated with risk and progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). These observations are typically interpreted as evidence that vascular abnormalities play an additive, independent role contributing to symptom presentation, but not core features of AD. We examined the severity and distribution of WMH in presymptomatic PSEN1, PSEN2, and APP mutation carriers to determine the extent to which WMH manifest in individuals genetically determined to develop AD. METHODS: The study comprised participants (n = 299; age = 39.03 {$\pm$} 10.13) from the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network, including 184 (61.5\%) with a mutation that results in AD and 115 (38.5\%) first-degree relatives who were noncarrier controls. We calculated the estimated years from expected symptom onset (EYO) by subtracting the affected parent's symptom onset age from the participant's age. Baseline MRI data were analyzed for total and regional WMH. Mixed-effects piece-wise linear regression was used to examine WMH differences between carriers and noncarriers with respect to EYO. RESULTS: Mutation carriers had greater total WMH volumes, which appeared to increase approximately 6 years before expected symptom onset. Effects were most prominent for the parietal and occipital lobe, which showed divergent effects as early as 22 years before estimated onset. INTERPRETATION: Autosomal-dominant AD is associated with increased WMH well before expected symptom onset. The findings suggest the possibility that WMHs are a core feature of AD, a potential therapeutic target, and a factor that should be integrated into pathogenic models of the disease.

We aimed to characterize the neuropathological changes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and determine the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms.In this autopsy study of the brain, we characterized the vascular pathology, the neuroinflammatory changes and cellular and humoral immune responses by immunohistochemistry.All patients died during the first wave of the pandemic from March to July 2020. All patients were adults who died after a short duration of the infection, some had died suddenly with minimal respiratory involvement. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed on ante-mortem or post-mortem testing. Descriptive analysis of the pathological changes and quantitative analyses of the infiltrates and vascular changes were performed.All patients had multifocal vascular damage as determined by leakage of serum proteins into the brain parenchyma. This was accompanied by widespread endothelial cell activation. Platelet aggregates and microthrombi were found adherent to the endothelial cells along vascular lumina. Immune complexes with activation of the classical complement pathway were found on the endothelial cells and platelets. Perivascular infiltrates consisted of predominantly macrophages and some CD8+ T cells. Only rare CD4+ T cells and CD20+ B cells were present. Astrogliosis was also prominent in the perivascular regions. Microglial nodules were predominant in the hindbrain, which were associated with focal neuronal loss and neuronophagia.Antibody-mediated cytotoxicity directed against the endothelial cells is the most likely initiating event that leads to vascular leakage, platelet aggregation, neuroinflammation and neuronal injury. Therapeutic modalities directed against immune complexes should be considered.},

A total of 869 cognitively normal (CN) individuals and 473 patients with probable AD dementia who underwent high-resolution 3T brain MRI were included. We propose a machine learning-based method for measuring the similarity of an individual subject's cortical atrophy pattern with that of a representative AD patient cohort. In addition, we validated this similarity measure in two longitudinal cohorts consisting of 79 patients with amnestic-mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) and 27 patients with probable AD dementia. Surface-based morphometry classifier for discriminating AD from CN showed sensitivity and specificity values of 87.1\% and 93.3\%, respectively. In the longitudinal validation study, aMCI-converts had higher atrophy similarity at both baseline (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and first year visits (p\,{$<$}\,0.001) relative to non-converters. Similarly, AD patients with faster decline had higher atrophy similarity than slower decliners at baseline (p\,=\,0.042), first year (p\,=\,0.028), and third year visits (p\,=\,0.027). The AD-specific atrophy similarity measure is a novel approach for the prediction of dementia risk and for the evaluation of AD trajectories on an individual subject level.}

In the present study, we report comprehensive heritability data of white matter microstructure fractional anisotropy (FA), radial diffusion (RD), and axial diffusion (AD) along 47 fiber tracts using the quantitative tractography in a large sample of neonatal twins (n=356). We found significant genetic influences in almost all tracts with similar heritabilities for FA, RD, and AD as well as positive relationships between these parameters and heritability. In a single tract analysis, genetic influences along the length of the tract were highly variable. These findings suggest that at birth, there is marked heterogeneity of genetic influences of white matter microstructure within white matter tracts. This study provides a basis for future studies of developmental changes in genetic and environmental influences during early childhood, a period of rapid development that likely plays a major role in individual differences in white matter structure and function.},

However, few studies have evaluated the relationship between CVD and {$\beta$}-amyloid burden in living humans or their synergistic effects on cognition. Thus, there is a need for better understanding of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) before clinical deterioration begins.To determine the synergistic effects of {$\beta$}-amyloid burden and CVD on cognition in patients with subcortical vascular MCI (svMCI).A cross-sectional study was conducted using a hospital-based sample at a tertiary referral center. We prospectively recruited 95 patients with svMCI; 67 of these individuals participated in the study. Forty-five patients with amnestic MCI (aMCI) were group matched with those with svMCI by the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale Sum of Boxes.We measured {$\beta$}-amyloid burden using positron emission tomography with carbon 11{\textendash}labeled Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB). Cerebrovascular disease was quantified as white matter hyperintensity volume detected by magnetic resonance imaging fluid-attenuated inversion recovery. Detailed neuropsychological tests were performed to determine the level of patients' cognitive impairment.On evaluation, 22 of the svMCI group (33\%) and 28 of the aMCI group (62\%) were found to be PiB positive. The mean PiB retention ratio was lower in patients with svMCI than in those with aMCI. In svMCI, the PiB retention ratio was associated with cognitive impairments in multiple domains, including language, visuospatial, memory, and frontal executive functions, but was associated only with memory dysfunction in aMCI. A significant interaction between PiB retention ratio and white matter hyperintensity volume was found to affect visuospatial function in patients with svMCI.Most patients with svMCI do not exhibit substantial amyloid burden, and CVD does not increase {$\beta$}-amyloid burden as measured by amyloid imaging. However, in patients with svMCI, amyloid burden and white matter hyperintensity act synergistically to impair visuospatial function. Therefore, our findings highlight the need for accurate biomarkers, including neuroimaging tools, for early diagnosis and the need to relate these biomarkers to cognitive measurements for effective use in the clinical setting.}

  abstract = {Objective To investigate the optimal combination of dietary polyphenols associated with the long-term risk of dementia in a large prospective French cohort of older persons, the Three-City (3C) Study.Methods We included 1,329 older adults without dementia from the 3C study with assessment of intake of 26 polyphenol subclasses who were followed up for 12 years for dementia. Using partial least squares for Cox models, we identified a pattern of polyphenol intake associated with dementia risk.Results The pattern combined several flavonoids (dihydroflavonols, anthocyanins, isoflavonoids, flavanones), stilbenes (including resveratrol), lignans, and other subclasses (hydroxybenzaldehydes, naphthoquinones, furanocoumarins). Compared with participants in the lower quintile of pattern score, those in the higher quintile had a 50\% lower risk of dementia (95\% confidence interval 20\%{\textendash}68\%, p for trend \&amp;lt;0.01) in multivariate models.Conclusions In this French cohort, a polyphenol pattern provided by a diet containing specific plant products (nuts, citrus, berries, leafy vegetables, soy, cereals, olive oil) accompanied by red wine and tea was associated with lower dementia risk.AD=Alzheimer disease; DSM-IV=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition; MIND=Mediterranean-Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay; MMSE=Mini-Mental State Examination; PAQUID=Personnes Ag{\'e}es Quid; PLS-Cox=partial least squares regression for Cox model; SU.VI.MAX=Suppl{\'e}mentation en Vitamines et.

After correction for total body fat mass, men had significantly higher values of visceral AT volume (P {$<$} 0.0001) and also higher abdominal visceral AT areas, measured by CT or estimated by predictive equations than women (P {$<$} 0.0001). In addition, an increase in total fat mass was associated with a significantly greater increase in visceral AT volume in men than in women (P {$<$} 0.0001).

The resulting changes are commonly analyzed using tensor-based morphometry to make inferences about anatomical differences, often based on the Jacobian map, which estimates local tissue gain or loss. Here, we provide rigorous mathematical analyses of the Jacobian maps, and use themto motivate a new numerical method to construct unbiased nonlinear image registration. First, we argue that logarithmic transformation is crucial for analyzing Jacobian values representing morphometric differences. We then examine the statistical distributions of log-Jacobian maps by defining the Kullback-Leibler (KL) distance on material density functions arising in continuum-mechanical models. With this framework, unbiased image registration can be constructed by quantifying the symmetric KL-distance between the identity map and the resulting deformation. Implementation details, addressing the proposed unbiased registration as well as the minimization of symmetric image matching functionals, are then discussed and shown to be applicable to other registration methods, such as inverse consistent registration. In the results section, we test the proposed framework, as well as present an illustrative application mapping detailed 3-D brain changes in sequential magnetic resonance imaging scans of a patient diagnosed with semantic dementia. Using permutation tests, we show that the symmetrization of image registration statistically reduces skewness in the log-Jacobian map. FAU - Leow, Alex D},

  abstract = {Abstract We present a Deep Learning framework for the prediction of chronological age from structural magnetic resonance imaging scans. Previous findings associate increased brain age with neurodegenerative diseases and higher mortality rates. However, the importance of brain age prediction goes beyond serving as biomarkers for neurological disorders. Specifically, utilizing convolutional neural network (CNN) analysis to identify brain regions contributing to the prediction can shed light on the complex multivariate process of brain aging. Previous work examined methods to attribute pixel/voxel-wise contributions to the prediction in a single image, resulting in ?explanation maps? that were found noisy and unreliable. To address this problem, we developed an inference scheme for combining these maps across subjects, thus creating a population-based, rather than a subject-specific map. We applied this method to a CNN ensemble trained on predicting subjects' age from raw T1 brain images in a lifespan sample of 10,176 subjects. Evaluating the model on an untouched test set resulted in mean absolute error of 3.07?years and a correlation between chronological and predicted age of r =?0.98. Using the inference method, we revealed that cavities containing cerebrospinal fluid, previously found as general atrophy markers, had the highest contribution for age prediction. Comparing maps derived from different models within the ensemble allowed to assess differences and similarities in brain regions utilized by the model. We showed that this method substantially increased the replicability of explanation maps, converged with results from voxel-based morphometry age studies and highlighted brain regions whose volumetric variability correlated the most with the prediction error.},

However, leptin receptors are found in brain regions other than the hypothalamus (including the hippocampus and cerebral cortex) suggesting extrahypothalamic functions. We investigated hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), and the spatial-memory function in two leptin receptor-deficient rodents (Zucker rats and db/db mice). In brain slices, the CA1 hippocampal region of both strains showed impairments of LTP and LTD; leptin (10(-12) M) did not improve these impairments in either strain. These strains also showed lower basal levels of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity in the CA1 region than the respective controls, and the levels did not respond to tetanic stimulation. These strains also showed impaired spatial memory in the Morris water-maze test (i.e. longer swim-path lengths during training sessions and less frequent crossings of the platform's original location in the probe test. From these results we suggest that the leptin receptor-deficient animals show impaired LTP in CA1 and poor spatial memory due, at least in part, to a deficiency in leptin receptors in the hippocampus.},

However, the risk could be very different for individuals with the same body mass. The present study explored whether regional fat distribution, as measured by waist-hip ratio (WHR), could modify the impact of BMI on the risk of CVD in men and women. Design: Prospective population-based study. Subjects: A total of 10369 men and 16638 women, 45-73 years old, from general population in Malmo, Sweden. Measurements: All subjects were followed over 7 years for the incidences of first-ever cardiac event (CE) and ischemic stroke in relation to BMI category ({$<$} 25.0, 25.0-29.9, {$>$}= 30.0) and WHR. Results: The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 39.4 and 13.0\%, respectively. During follow-up, 1280 subjects suffered a CVD event (750 CE, 530 ischemic stroke). The risk of CVD in women increased with increasing levels of WHR, irrespective of BMI category. In men, WHR (per 1 s.d. increase) was associated with increased incidence of CVD in those with normal weight (relative risk (RR) = 1.24; 95\% CI: 1.13-1.37) after adjustments for confounding factors. However, WHR was not related to CVD in overweight men (RR = 1.06; 95\% CI: 0.94-1.20) or obese men (RR = 1.04; 95\% CI: 0.87-1.24). A significant interaction was observed between sex and WHR on the CVD risk. Conclusion: The effect of WHR on incidence of CVD is modified by the overall body weight and by gender. WHR adds prognostic information on the cardiovascular risk in women at all levels of BMI, and in men with normal weight.},

Materials and methods OS depth was obtained using T1 magnetic resonance imaging scans. Participants (mean age~{$\pm~$}sd~=~57~{$\pm~$}16~years, ranging from 20 to 80~years) were screened for olfactory function using the Sniffin' Sticks Screening 12 test. They were divided into an olfactory dysfunction group (n~=~604) and a normosmia group (n~=~493). Participants also completed questionnaires measuring depression, anxiety and quality of life. Results The right OS was deeper than the left side in all age groups. On the left side, women had deeper OS compared with men, exhibiting a higher degree of symmetry in left and right OS depth in women. Variance of olfactory function was largely determined by age, OS depth explained only minor portions of this variance. Normative data for minimum OS depth was 7.55~mm on the left and 8.78~mm on the right for participants aged between 18 and 35~years (n~=~144), 6.47~mm on the left and 6.99~mm on the right for those aged 36{\textendash}55~years (n~=~120), and 5.28~mm on the left and 6.19~mm on the right for participants older than 55~years (n~=~222). Conclusion Considering the limited resolution of the presently used T1 weighted MR scans and the nature of the olfactory screening test, OS depth explained only minor portions of the variance of olfactory function, which was largely determined by age.

The authors developed and validated a prediction model to calculate the 10-year absolute risk of developing dementia in an aging population. METHODS: In a large, prospective population-based cohort, data were collected on demographic, clinical, neuropsychological, genetic, and neuroimaging parameters from 2,710 nondemented individuals age 60 or older, examined between 1995 and 2011. A basic and an extended model were derived to predict 10-year risk of dementia while taking into account competing risks from death due to other causes. Model performance was assessed using optimism-corrected C-statistics and calibration plots, and the models were externally validated in the Dutch population-based Epidemiological Prevention Study of Zoetermeer and in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative cohort 1 (ADNI-1). RESULTS: During a follow-up of 20,324 person-years, 181 participants developed dementia. A basic dementia risk model using age, history of stroke, subjective memory decline, and need for assistance with finances or medication yielded a C-statistic of 0.78 (95\% CI=0.75, 0.81). Subsequently, an extended model incorporating the basic model and additional cognitive, genetic, and imaging predictors yielded a C-statistic of 0.86 (95\% CI=0.83, 0.88). The models performed well in external validation cohorts from Europe and the United States. CONCLUSIONS: In community-dwelling individuals, 10-year dementia risk can be accurately predicted by combining information on readily available predictors in the primary care setting. Dementia prediction can be further improved by using data on cognitive performance, genotyping, and brain imaging. These models can be used to identify individuals at high risk of dementia in the population and are able to inform trial design.},

  abstract = {To systematically review the literature for dementia prediction models for use in the general population and externally validate their performance in a head-to-head comparison. We selected four prediction models for validation: CAIDE, BDSI, ANU-ADRI and DRS. From the Rotterdam Study, 6667 non-demented individuals aged 55 years and older were assessed between 1997 and 2001. Subsequently, participants were followed for dementia until 1 January, 2015. For each individual, we computed the risk of dementia using the reported scores from each prediction model. We used the C-statistic and calibration plots to assess the performance of each model to predict 10-year risk of all-cause dementia. For comparisons, we also evaluated discriminative accuracy using only the age component of these risk scores for each model separately. During 75,581 person-years of follow-up, 867 participants developed dementia. C-statistics for 10-year dementia risk prediction were 0.55 (95\% CI 0.53-0.58) for CAIDE, 0.78 (0.76-0.81) for BDSI, 0.75 (0.74-0.77) for ANU-ADRI, and 0.81 (0.78-0.83) for DRS. Calibration plots showed that predicted risks were too extreme with underestimation at low risk and overestimation at high risk. Importantly, in all models age alone already showed nearly identical discriminative accuracy as the full model (C-statistics: 0.55 (0.53-0.58) for CAIDE, 0.81 (0.78-0.83) for BDSI, 0.77 (0.75-0.79) for ANU-ADRI, and 0.81 (0.78-0.83) for DRS). In this study, we found high variability in discriminative ability for predicting dementia in an elderly, community-dwelling population. All models showed similar discriminative ability when compared to prediction based on age alone. These findings highlight the urgent need for updated or new models to predict dementia risk in the general population.},

  abstract = {Introduction It is challenging at baseline to predict when and which individuals who meet criteria for mild cognitive impairment (MCI) will ultimately progress to Alzheimer's disease (AD) dementia. Methods A deep learning method is developed and validated based on magnetic resonance imaging scans of 2146 subjects (803 for training and 1343 for validation) to predict MCI subjects' progression to AD dementia in a time-to-event analysis setting. Results The deep-learning time-to-event model predicted individual subjects' progression to AD dementia with a concordance index of 0.762 on 439 Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 6 to 78~months (quartiles: [24, 42, 54]) and a concordance index of 0.781 on 40 Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle Study of Aging testing MCI subjects with follow-up duration from 18 to 54~months (quartiles: [18, 36, 54]). The predicted progression risk also clustered individual subjects into subgroups with significant differences in their progression time to AD dementia (P~{$<~$}.0002). Improved performance for predicting progression to AD dementia (concordance index~=~0.864) was obtained when the deep learning{\textendash}based progression risk was combined with baseline clinical measures. Discussion Our method provides a cost effective and accurate means for prognosis and potentially to facilitate enrollment in clinical trials with individuals likely to progress within a specific temporal period.},

While prior brain-age prediction studies have relied exclusively on either structural or functional brain data, here we investigate how multimodal brain-imaging data improves age prediction. Using cortical anatomy and whole-brain functional connectivity on a large adult lifespan sample (N=2354, age 19-82), we found that multimodal data improves brain-based age prediction, resulting in a mean absolute prediction error of 4.29 years. Furthermore, we found that the discrepancy between predicted age and chronological age captures cognitive impairment. Importantly, the brain-age measure was robust to confounding effects: head motion did not drive brain-based age prediction and our models generalized reasonably to an independent dataset acquired at a different site (N=475). Generalization performance was increased by training models on a larger and more heterogeneous dataset. The robustness of multimodal brain-age prediction to confounds, generalizability across sites, and sensitivity to clinically-relevant impairments, suggests promising future application to the early prediction of neurocognitive disorders.},

  abstract = {Abstract Multivariate analysis methods such as independent component analysis (ICA) have been applied to the analysis of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to study brain function. Because of the high dimensionality and high noise level of the fMRI data, order selection, i.e., estimation of the number of informative components, is critical to reduce over/underfitting in such methods. Dependence among fMRI data samples in the spatial and temporal domain limits the usefulness of the practical formulations of information-theoretic criteria (ITC) for order selection, since they are based on likelihood of independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data samples. To address this issue, we propose a subsampling scheme to obtain a set of effectively i.i.d. samples from the dependent data samples and apply the ITC formulas to the effectively i.i.d. sample set for order selection. We apply the proposed method on the simulated data and show that it significantly improves the accuracy of order selection from dependent data. We also perform order selection on fMRI data from a visuomotor task and show that the proposed method alleviates the over-estimation on the number of brain sources due to the intrinsic smoothness and the smooth preprocessing of fMRI data. We use the software package ICASSO (Himberg et al. [ 2004]: Neuroimage 22:1214?1222) to analyze the independent component (IC) estimates at different orders and show that, when ICA is performed at overestimated orders, the stability of the IC estimates decreases and the estimation of task related brain activations show degradation.

  abstract = {A re-analysis of intraclass correlation (ICC) theory is presented together with Monte Carlo simulations of ICC probability distributions. A partly revised and simplified theory of the single-score ICC is obtained, together with an alternative and simple recipe for its use in reliability studies. Our main, practical conclusion is that in the analysis of a reliability study it is neither necessary nor convenient to start from an initial choice of a specified statistical model. Rather, one may impartially use all three single-score ICC formulas. A near equality of the three ICC values indicates the absence of bias (systematic error), in which case the classical (one-way random) ICC may be used. A consistency ICC larger than absolute agreement ICC indicates the presence of non-negligible bias; if so, classical ICC is invalid and misleading. An F-test may be used to confirm whether biases are present. From the resulting model (without or with bias) variances and confidence intervals may then be calculated. In presence of bias, both absolute agreement ICC and consistency ICC should be reported, since they give different and complementary information about the reliability of the method. A clinical example with data from the literature is given.}

  abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a transitional stage from normal aging to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and corresponds to a higher risk of developing AD. Thus, it is necessary to explore and predict the onset of AD in MCI stage. In this study, we propose a combination of independent component analysis (ICA) and the multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model to investigate promising risk factors associated with MCI conversion among 126 MCI converters and 108 MCI non-converters from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. Using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) data, we extracted brain networks from AD and normal control groups via ICA and then constructed Cox models that included network-based neuroimaging factors for the MCI group. We carried out five separate Cox analyses and the two-modality neuroimaging Cox model identified three significant network-based risk factors with higher prediction performance (accuracy = 73.50\%) than those in either single-modality model (accuracy = 68.80\%). Additionally, the results of the comprehensive Cox model, including significant neuroimaging factors and clinical variables, demonstrated that MCI individuals with reduced gray matter volume in a temporal lobe-related network of structural MRI [hazard ratio (HR) = 8.29E-05 (95\% confidence interval (CI), 5.10E- 07 {\textasciitilde} 0.013)], low glucose metabolism in the posterior default mode network based on FDG-PET [HR = 0.066 (95\% CI, 4.63E-03 {\textasciitilde} 0.928)], positive apolipoprotein E {$\epsilon$}4-status [HR = 1. 988 (95\% CI, 1.531 {\textasciitilde} 2.581)], increased Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale scores [HR = 1.100 (95\% CI, 1.059 {\textasciitilde} 1.144)] and Sum of Boxes of Clinical Dementia Rating scores [HR = 1.622 (95\% CI, 1.364 {\textasciitilde} 1.930)] were more likely to convert to AD within 36 months after baselines. These significant risk factors in such comprehensive Cox model had the best prediction ability (accuracy = 84.62\%, sensitivity = 86.51\%, specificity = 82.41\%) compared to either neuroimaging factors or clinical variables alone. These results suggested that a combination of ICA and Cox model analyses could be used successfully in survival analysis and provide a network-based perspective of MCI progression or AD-related studies.}

It is the first study of this kind and size in an urban population in the eastern part of Germany. The study is conducted by the Leipzig Research Centre for Civilization Diseases (LIFE). Our objective is to investigate prevalences, early onset markers, genetic predispositions, and the role of lifestyle factors of major civilization diseases, with primary focus on metabolic and vascular diseases, heart function, cognitive impairment, brain function, depression, sleep disorders and vigilance dysregulation, retinal and optic nerve degeneration, and allergies. METHODS/DESIGN: The study covers a main age range from 40-79 years with particular deep phenotyping in elderly participants above the age of 60. The baseline examination was conducted from August 2011 to November 2014. All participants underwent an extensive core assessment programme (5-6 h) including structured interviews, questionnaires, physical examinations, and biospecimen collection. Participants over 60 underwent two additional assessment programmes (3-4 h each) on two separate visits including deeper cognitive testing, brain magnetic resonance imaging, diagnostic interviews for depression, and electroencephalography. DISCUSSION: The participation rate was 33 \%. The assessment programme was accepted well and completely passed by almost all participants. Biomarker analyses have already been performed in all participants. Genotype, transcriptome and metabolome analyses have been conducted in subgroups. The first follow-up examination will commence in 2016.},

  abstract = {Background and Objectives Mounting evidence implies that there are sex differences in white matter hyperintensity (WMH) burden in older people. Questions remain regarding possible differences in WMH burden between men and women of younger age, sex-specific age trajectories and effects of (un)controlled hypertension, and the effect of menopause on WMH. Therefore, our aim was to investigate these sex differences and age dependencies in WMH load across the adult life span and to examine the effect of menopause. Methods This cross-sectional analysis was based on participants of the population-based Rhineland Study (30{\textendash}95 years) who underwent brain MRI. We automatically quantified WMH using T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images. Menopausal status was self-reported. We examined associations of sex and menopause with WMH load (logit-transformed and z-standardized) using linear regression models while adjusting for age, age-squared, and vascular risk factors. We checked for an age {\texttimes} sex and (un)controlled hypertension {\texttimes} sex interaction and stratified for menopausal status comparing men with premenopausal women (persons aged 59 years or younger), men with postmenopausal women (persons aged 45 years or older), and premenopausal with postmenopausal women (age range 45{\textendash}59 years). Results Of 3,410 participants with a mean age of 54.3 years (SD = 13.7), 1,973 (57.9\%) were women, of which 1,167 (59.1\%) were postmenopausal. We found that the increase in WMH load accelerates with age and in a sex-dependent way. Premenopausal women and men of similar age did not differ in WMH burden. WMH burden was higher and accelerated faster in postmenopausal women compared with men of similar age. In addition, we observed changes related to menopause, in that postmenopausal women had more WMH than premenopausal women of similar age. Women with uncontrolled hypertension had a higher WMH burden compared with men, which was unrelated to menopausal status. Discussion After menopause, women displayed a higher burden of WMH than contemporary premenopausal women and men and an accelerated increase in WMH. Sex-specific effects of uncontrolled hypertension on WMH were not related to menopause. Further studies are warranted to investigate menopause-related physiologic changes that may inform on causal mechanisms involved in cerebral small vessel disease progression.},

  abstract = {The proposition of so-called 'food addiction' (FA) in the scientific literature has stimulated a recent surge in research and debate. The concept of FA is controversial, and opinion is divided. Many of the findings depend upon the use of a single instrument called the Yale Food Addiction Scale (YFAS). This review systematically examined FA, as defined by the YFAS, reported in 40 experimental human studies published in or after 2009. The results indicated that much of the literature makes the supposition that food addiction is an accepted neurobiological disease, consistent with substance use disorders; an interpretation based on very limited data. This raises the question as to whether those individuals who meet the YFAS criteria for diagnosis are truly 'addicted' to food or if they experience significant impairment to their psychological wellbeing and quality of life as would be expected in clinically recognised addictive disorders. At the present time, little research has investigated the extent to which a psychometric self-assessment of FA symptomatology can elucidate a harmful relationship with target foods in the diet. A positive YFAS diagnosis is usually positively associated with BMI and strongly linked with the presence of binge eating, but certain exceptions within the literature were revealed. Further clarification is required as to whether so-called FA is sufficiently different to existing conditions and traits to warrant classification as a distinctive disease phenotype rather than an expression of strong habits and preferences.}

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) have a heterogeneous aetiology, associated with both vascular risk factors and amyloidosis due to Alzheimer's disease. While spatial distribution of both amyloid and WM lesions carry important information for the underlying pathogenic mechanisms, the regional relationship between these two pathologies and their joint contribution to early cognitive deterioration remains largely unexplored. We included 662 non-demented participants from three Amyloid Imaging to Prevent Alzheimer's disease (AMYPAD)-affiliated cohorts: EPAD-LCS (N = 176), ALFA+ (N = 310), and EMIF-AD PreclinAD Twin60++ (N = 176). Using PET imaging, cortical amyloid burden was assessed regionally within early accumulating regions (medial orbitofrontal, precuneus, and cuneus) and globally, using the Centiloid method. Regional WMH volume was computed using Bayesian Model Selection. Global associations between WMH, amyloid, and cardiovascular risk scores (Framingham and CAIDE) were assessed using linear models. Partial least square (PLS) regression was used to identify regional associations. Models were adjusted for age, sex, and APOE-e4 status. Individual PLS scores were then related to cognitive performance in 4 domains (attention, memory, executive functioning, and language). While no significant global association was found, the PLS model yielded two components of interest. In the first PLS component, a fronto-parietal WMH pattern was associated with medial orbitofrontal-precuneal amyloid, vascular risk, and age. Component 2 showed a posterior WMH pattern associated with precuneus-cuneus amyloid, less related to age or vascular risk. Component 1 was associated with lower performance in all cognitive domains, while component 2 only with worse memory. In a large pre-dementia population, we observed two distinct patterns of regional associations between WMH and amyloid burden, and demonstrated their joint influence on cognitive processes. These two components could reflect the existence of vascular-dependent and -independent manifestations of WMH-amyloid regional association that might be related to distinct primary pathophysiology.},

  abstract = {Background Markers of cerebrovascular disease are common in dementia, and may be present before dementia onset. However, their clinical relevance in midlife adults at risk of future dementia remains unclear. We investigated whether the Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Ageing and Dementia (CAIDE) risk score was associated with markers of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), and if it predicted future progression of SVD. We also determined its relationship to systemic inflammation, which has been additionally implicated in dementia and SVD. Methods Cognitively healthy midlife participants were assessed at baseline (n=185) and 2-year follow-up (n=158). To assess SVD, we quantified white matter hyperintensities (WMH), enlarged perivascular spaces (EPVS), microbleeds and lacunes. We derived composite scores of SVD burden, and subtypes of hypertensive arteriopathy and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Inflammation was quantified using serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and fibrinogen. Results At baseline, higher CAIDE scores were associated with all markers of SVD and inflammation. Longitudinally, CAIDE scores predicted greater total (p{$<$}0.001), periventricular (p{$<$}0.001) and deep (p=0.012) WMH progression, and increased CRP (p=0.017). Assessment of individual CAIDE components suggested that markers were driven by different risk factors (WMH/EPVS: age/hypertension, lacunes/deep microbleeds: hypertension/obesity). Interaction analyses demonstrated that higher CAIDE scores amplified the effect of age on SVD, and the effect of WMH on poorer memory. Conclusion Higher CAIDE scores, indicating greater risk of dementia, predicts future progression of both WMH and systemic inflammation. Findings highlight the CAIDE score's potential as both a prognostic and predictive marker in the context of cerebrovascular disease, identifying at-risk individuals who might benefit most from managing modifiable risk.},

  abstract = {The lateralization of the human brain may provide clues into the pathogenesis and progression of neurodegenerative diseases. Though differing in their presentation and underlying pathologies, neurodegenerative diseases are all devastating and share an intriguing theme of asymmetrical pathology and clinical symptoms. Parkinson's disease, with its distinctive onset of motor symptoms on one side of the body, stands out in this regard, but a review of the literature reveals asymmetries in several other neurodegenerative diseases. Here, we review the lateralization of the structure and function of the healthy human brain and the common genetic and epigenetic patterns contributing to the development of asymmetry in health and disease. We specifically examine the role of asymmetry in Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis, and interrogate whether these imbalances may reveal meaningful clues about the origins of these diseases. We also propose several hypotheses for how lateralization may contribute to the distinctive and enigmatic features of asymmetry in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a role for asymmetry in the choroid plexus, neurochemistry, protein distribution, brain connectivity and the vagus nerve. Finally, we suggest how future studies may reveal novel insights into these diseases through the lens of asymmetry.},

Adherence to the MeDi was calculated from data gathered from a food frequency questionnaire at age 70, 3 years prior to the baseline imaging data collection.Results: In regression models adjusting for relevant demographic and physical health indicators, we found that lower adherence to the MeDi was associated with greater 3-year reduction in total brain volume (explaining 0.5\% of variance, p \&amp;lt; 0.05). This effect was half the size of the largest covariate effect (i.e., age). Cross-sectional associations between MeDi and baseline MRI measures in 562 participants were not significant. Targeted analyses of meat and fish consumption did not replicate previous associations with total brain volume or total gray matter volume.Conclusions: Lower adherence to the MeDi in an older Scottish cohort is predictive of total brain atrophy over a 3-year interval. Fish and meat consumption does not drive this change, suggesting that other components of the MeDi or, possibly, all of its components in combination are responsible for the association.BMI=body mass index; GMV=gray matter volume; ICV=intracranial volume; MeDi=Mediterranean-type diet; MMSE=Mini-Mental State Examination; NART=National Adult Reading Test; TBV=total brain volume}

We provide new empirical data on miNCD including total, age-, and sex-specific prevalence rates; number and types of neurocognitive domains being impaired; and diagnostic overlap with the well-established mild cognitive impairment (MCI) concept. Design Cross-sectional results of an observational cohort study (LIFE-Adult-Study). Setting General population. Participants A total of 1,080 dementia-free individuals, aged 60{\textendash}79 years. Measurements We calculated weighted point prevalence rates with confidence intervals (95\% CI) for miNCD and analyzed diagnostic overlap between miNCD and MCI by calculating overall percentage agreement and Cohen's kappa coefficient. Results Weighted total prevalence of miNCD was 20.3\% (95\% CI: 17.8{\textendash}23.0). Prevalence was similar in both sexes, but significantly higher in older age. Two-thirds (66.2\%) of the individuals with miNCD showed impairment restricted to only one out of six possible neurocognitive domains. Learning and memory was the most frequently (38.3\%) impaired domain in all miNCD-cases, followed by social cognition (26.1\%). Analysis of diagnostic overlap with MCI yielded an overall agreement of 98.6\% and a kappa of 0.959. Conclusions By considering all six predefined neurocognitive domains, our study observed a substantial proportion of dementia-free older adults having miNCD. Provision of information on the underlying etiology/ies may be of prime importance in future studies aiming at evaluating the clinical relevance of the miNCD syndrome.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is a growing literature documenting a variety of brain abnormalities associated with obesity. However, little is known about the effects of obesity on inter-hemispheric connectivity in aging people. METHODS: Participants included 61 cognitively intact elderly (including people with obesity, overweight, and lean controls) who underwent structural MRI, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) and standard neuropsychological batteries. Techniques including FreeSurfer and Voxel-mirrored Homotopic Connectivity (VMHC) were employed to evaluate inter-hemispheric structural and functional connectivity respectively. RESULTS: There were no differences of cognitive abilities and vascular risks among groups. When compared to lean controls, obese group had greater VMHC in fusiform gyrus (FG); while overweight group had greater VMHC in FG, calcarine gyrus, inferior temporal gyrus (ITG), and postcentral gyrus (PCG). Moreover, the obesity group had lower VMHC in calcarine gyrus and PCG than overweight group (p{$<$}0.05, corrected). CONCLUSIONS: The present study suggested, increased inter-hemispheric information transmission in networks supporting visual and sensorimotor function may lead to gain in weight, by possibly mediating diet behaviours of individuals.},

Accordingly, the aim of this study was to examine the role of white matter microstructural integrity in hypertension-related cognitive detriments. We recruited 66 cognitively normal older adults, comprising 41 hypertensive patients and 25 normotensive controls. All participants underwent a comprehensive neuropsychological battery. White matter microstructural integrity was assessed using a tract-based automatic analysis approach derived from diffusion spectrum imaging. Mediating effects of white matter integrity were evaluated using structural equation modeling analyses. The results revealed that hypertensive older adults displayed poorer processing speed, executive function, and memory encoding. Lower white matter microstructural integrity was observed in the hypertensive elderly patients, primarily in long-range association fiber bundles. In particular, low microstructural integrity in specific tract bundles connecting frontal and posterior cerebral regions was found to underlie the adverse relationships between hypertension and multiple cognitive domains, including processing speed, executive function, memory encoding, and memory retention. Our findings suggest that hypertension may impair multiple cognitive functions by undermining white matter microstructures, even in cognitively intact older adults, thus further highlighting the necessity of monitoring vascular health to prevent cognitive decline.},

Leptin-sensitive subjects have normal resting energy expenditure (REE) at a low leptin concentration, while leptin-resistant subjects have a normal REE at a higher leptin concentration; thus, the ratio of REE:Leptin may provide a surrogate index of leptin sensitivity. We examined changes in REE and leptin in a cohort of 17 obese subjects during experimental weight loss therapy with the insulin-suppressive agent octreotide-LAR, 40 mg i.m. q28d for 6 months. Six subjects lost significant weight ({$>$}10\%) and BMI ({$>$}-3 kg/m(2)) with a 34\% decline in leptin and a 46\% decrease in insulin area under the curve (IAUC) to oral glucose tolerance testing. These subjects maintained their pretreatment REE, and thus exhibited a rise in REE:Leptin, while the other 11 showed minimal changes in each of these parameters. For the entire cohort, the change in IAUC correlated negatively with the change in REE:Leptin. These results suggest that the REE:Leptin ratio, while derivative, may serve as a useful clinical indicator of changes in leptin sensitivity within obese subjects. They also support the possibilities that hyperinsulinemia may be a proximate cause of leptin resistance, and that reduction of insulinemia may promote weight loss by improving leptin sensitivity.},

This systematic review aimed to examine the functional brain changes that may underlie cognitive dysfunction in adults with T2DM. Studies were restricted to those which used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Nineteen independent studies were identified, mostly comprised of middle aged or older adults. Resting-state studies demonstrated that compared to controls, connectivity of the Default Mode Network (DMN) was reduced and the majority of task-based studies identified reduced activation in T2DM patients in regions relevant to task performance. Abnormalities of low frequency spontaneous brain activity were observed, particularly in visual regions. As most studies demonstrated that alterations in fMRI were related to poorer neuropsychological task performance, these results indicate that functional brain abnormalities in T2DM have consequences for cognition.},

The distribution of CRP in a healthy blood donor population (n = 143) was nongaussian, with 2.5th, 50th, and 97.5th percentile values of 0.08, 0.64, and 3.11 mg/L, respectively. There was no sex-related difference, and the association with age was weak. In a study of variability [by the method of Fraser and Harris (Crit Rev Clin Lab Sci 1989;27:409{\textendash}37)], the analytical variability was 5.2\%; the within-subject variability, CVI, was 42.2\%; and the between-subject variability, CVG, was 92.5\%. The critical difference for sequential values significant at P {$\leq$}0.05 (i.e., the smallest percentage change unlikely to be due to analytical variability or CVI) was calculated as 118\%, and the index of individuality, CVI/CVG, was 0.46. This suggests that CRP, like many clinical chemistry analytes, has limited usefulness in detecting early disease-associated changes when used in conjunction with a healthy reference interval. From a molecular epidemiological standpoint, the usefulness of CRP in longitudinal studies is suggested by the small index of individuality and by observations that (a) short-term fluctuations were infrequent, (b) all data stayed within the reference interval, and (c) relative rankings of the subjects over 6 months only moderately deteriorated.}

METHODS: The first step is the identification of white matter (WM) tissue using a multispectral (T1, T2, PD) segmentation. In a second step, WMH are identified within the WM tissue by segmenting T2 images, isolating two different classes of WMH voxels - low- and high-contrast WMH voxels, respectively. The reliability of the whole procedure was assessed by applying it to the analysis of two large MR imaging databases (n = 650 and n= 710, respectively) of healthy elderly subjects matched for demographic characteristics. RESULTS: Average overall WMH load and spatial distribution were found to be similar in the two samples, (1.81 and 1.79\% of the WM volume, respectively). White matter hyperintensity load was found to be significantly associated with both age and high blood pressure, with similar effects in both samples. With specific reference to the 650 subject cohort, we also found that WMH load provided by this automated procedure was significantly associated with visual grading of the severity of WMH, as assessed by a trained neurologist. CONCLUSION: The results show that this method is sensitive, well correlated with semi-quantitative visual rating and highly reproducible.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Previous studies have identified effects of age and vascular risk factors on brain injury in elderly individuals. We aimed to establish whether the effects of high blood pressure in the brain are evident as early as the fifth decade of life. METHODS: In an investigation of the third generation of the Framingham Heart Study, we approached all participants in 2009 to ask whether they would be willing to undergo MRI. Consenting patients underwent clinical assessment and cerebral MRI that included T1-weighted and diffusion tensor imaging to obtain estimates of fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and grey-matter volumes. All images were coregistered to a common minimum deformation template for voxel-based linear regressions relating fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and grey-matter volumes to age and systolic blood pressure, with adjustment for potential confounders. FINDINGS: 579 (14{$\cdot$}1\%) of 4095 participants in the third-generation cohort (mean age 39{$\cdot$}2 years, SD 8{$\cdot$}4) underwent brain MRI between June, 2009 and June, 2010. Age was associated with decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in almost all cerebral white-matter voxels. Age was also independently associated with reduced grey-matter volumes. Increased systolic blood pressure was linearly associated with decreased regional fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity, especially in the anterior corpus callosum, the inferior fronto-occipital fasciculi, and the fibres that project from the thalamus to the superior frontal gyrus. It was also strongly associated with reduced grey-matter volumes, particularly in Brodmann's area 48 on the medial surface of the temporal lobe and Brodmann's area 21 of the middle temporal gyrus. INTERPRETATION: Our results suggest that subtle vascular brain injury develops insidiously during life, with discernible effects even in young adults. These findings emphasise the need for early and optimum control of blood pressure.

We aimed at exploring the effects of BMI levels on cerebral resting-state metabolism and brain connectivity, as crucial measures of synaptic function and activity, in a large group of patients with Alzheimer's Dementia (AD) (n\,=\,206), considering gender. We tested the correlation between BMI levels and brain metabolism, as assessed by 18F-FDG-PET, and the modulation of the resting-state functional networks by BMI. At comparable dementia severity, females with high BMI can withstand a lower degree of brain metabolism dysfunction, as shown by a significant BMI-brain metabolism correlation in the temporal-parietal regions, which are typically vulnerable to AD pathology (R\,=\,0.269, p\,=\,0.009). Of note, high BMI was also associated with reduced connectivity in frontal and limbic brain networks, again only in AD females (p\,{$<$}\,0.05 FDR-corrected, k\,=\,100 voxels). This suggests a major vulnerability of neural systems known to be selectively involved in brain compensatory mechanisms in AD females. These findings indicate a strong gender effect of high BMI and obesity in AD, namely reducing the available reserve mechanisms in female patients. This brings to considerations for medical practice and health policy.}

  abstract = {Background: Other than its direct impact on cardiopulmonary health, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection affects additional body systems, especially in older adults. Several studies have reported acute neurological symptoms that present at onset or develop during hospitalisation, with associated neural injuries. Whilst the acute neurological phase is widely documented, the long-term consequences of COVID-19 infection on neurocognitive functioning remain unknown. Although an evidence-based framework describing the disease chronic phase is premature, it is important to lay the foundations for future data-driven models. This systematic review aimed at summarising the literature on neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older over-60 patients with COVID-19 following a cognitive neuroscientific perspective, to clarify the most vulnerable brain areas and speculate on the possible cognitive consequences.Methods: PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant manuscripts published between 1st March 2020 and 31th December 2020. Outputs were screened and selected by two assessors. Relevant studies not detected by literature search were added manually.Results: Ninety studies, mainly single cases and case series, were included. Several neuroimaging and neuropathological findings in older patients with COVID-19 emerged from these studies, with cerebrovascular damage having a prominent role. Abnormalities (hyperintensities, hypoperfusion, inflammation, and cellular damage) were reported in most brain areas. The most consistent cross-aetiology findings were in white matter, brainstem and fronto-temporal areas. Viral DNA was detected mainly in olfactory, orbitofrontal and brainstem areas.Conclusion: Studies on COVID-19 related neural damage are rich and diverse, but limited to description of hospitalised patients with fatal outcome (i.e., in neuropathological studies) or severe symptoms (i.e., in neuroimaging studies). The damage seen in this population indicates acute and largely irreversible dysfunction to neural regions involved in major functional networks that support normal cognitive and behavioural functioning. It is still unknown whether the long-term impact of the virus will be limited to chronic evolution of acute events, whether sub-clinical pathological processes will be exacerbated or whether novel mechanisms will emerge. Based on current literature, future theoretical frameworks describing the long-term impact of COVID-19 infection on mental abilities will have to factor in major trends of aetiological and topographic heterogeneity.}

  abstract = {Patients with type 2 diabetes demonstrate reduced functional connectivity within the resting state default mode network (DMN), which may signal heightened risk for cognitive decline. In other populations at risk for cognitive decline, additional magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities are evident during task performance, including impaired deactivation of the DMN and reduced activation of task-relevant regions. We investigated whether middle-aged type 2 diabetic patients show these brain activity patterns during encoding and recognition tasks. Compared with control participants, we observed both reduced 1) activation of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex during encoding and 2) deactivation of the DMN during recognition in type 2 diabetic patients, despite normal cognition. During recognition, activation in several task-relevant regions, including the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and DMN regions, was positively correlated with HbA1c and insulin resistance, suggesting that these important markers of glucose metabolism impact the brain's response to a cognitive challenge. Plasma glucose {$>$}/=11 mmol/L was associated with impaired deactivation of the DMN, suggesting that acute hyperglycemia contributes to brain abnormalities. Since elderly type 2 diabetic patients often demonstrate cognitive impairments, it is possible that these task-induced brain activity patterns observed in middle age may signal impending cognitive decline.},

Here we present functional connectivity analyses of this region using resting-state functional MRI data collected from both humans and macaque monkeys. Three distinct patterns of functional connectivity were demonstrated within the precuneus of both species, with each subdivision suggesting a discrete functional role: (i) the anterior precuneus, functionally connected with the superior parietal cortex, paracentral lobule, and motor cortex, suggesting a sensorimotor region; (ii) the central precuneus, functionally connected to the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial prefrontal, and multimodal lateral inferior parietal cortex, suggesting a cognitive/associative region; and (iii) the posterior precuneus, displaying functional connectivity with adjacent visual cortical regions. These functional connectivity patterns were differentiated from the more ventral networks associated with the posterior cingulate, which connected with limbic structures such as the medial temporal cortex, dorsal and ventromedial prefrontal regions, posterior lateral inferior parietal regions, and the lateral temporal cortex. Our findings are consistent with predictions from anatomical tracer studies in the monkey, and provide support that resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) may in part reflect underlying anatomy. These subdivisions within the precuneus suggest that neuroimaging studies will benefit from treating this region as anatomically (and thus functionally) heterogeneous. Furthermore, the consistency between functional connectivity networks in monkeys and humans provides support for RSFC as a viable tool for addressing cross-species comparisons of functional neuroanatomy.},

  abstract = {Working memory capacity is extremely limited and individual differences are heritable to a considerable extent. In the search for a better understanding of the exact genetic underpinnings of working memory, most research has focused on functional gene variants involved in the metabolism of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Recently, there has been investigation of genes related to other neurotransmitter systems such as acetylcholine. The potential relevance of a polymorphism located in the gene coding for the alpha4 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (rs\#1044396) has been discussed with respect to working memory, but empirical investigations have provided mixed results. However, pharmacological studies in both rodents and humans have shown that the effect of nicotinic agonists on cognitive functions is mediated by dopamine. We therefore hypothesized that such an interaction can be found on a molecular genetic level as well. In order to test this hypothesis, we genotyped 101 healthy subjects for rs\#1044396 and three functional polymorphisms on the dopamine d2 receptor gene (rs\#1800497, rs\#6277, rs\#2283265). These subjects performed a visuospatial working memory task in which memory load was systematically varied. We found a significant interaction between rs\#1044396 and a haplotype block covering all three dopaminergic polymorphisms on working memory capacity. This effect only became apparent on higher levels of working memory load. This is the first evidence from a molecular genetic perspective that these two neurotransmitter systems interact on cognitive functioning. The results are discussed with regard to their implication for working memory theories and their clinical relevance for treatment of substance abuse and schizophrenia.},

  abstract = {Background: Findings from animal and epidemiological research support the potential neuroprotective benefits from healthy diets. However, to establish diet-neuroprotective causal relations, evidence from dietary intervention studies is needed. NU-AGE is the first multicenter intervention assessing whether a diet targeting health in aging can counteract the age-related physiological changes in different organs, including the brain. In this study, we specifically investigated the effects of NU-AGE's dietary intervention on age-related cognitive decline. Materials and Methods: NU-AGE randomized trial (NCT01754012, clinicaltrials.gov) included 1279 relatively healthy older-adults, aged 65-79 years, from five European centers. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups: "control" (n = 638), following a habitual diet; and, "intervention" (n = 641), given individually tailored dietary advice (NU-AGE diet). Adherence to the NU-AGE diet was measured over follow-up, and categorized into tertiles (low, moderate, high). Cognitive function was ascertained at baseline and at 1-year follow-up with the Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD)-Neuropsychological Battery and five additional domain-specific single cognitive tests. The raw scores from the CERAD subtests [excluding the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE)] and the single tests were standardized into Z-scores. Global cognition (measured with MMSE and CERAD-total score), and five cognitive domains (perceptual speed, executive function, episodic memory, verbal abilities, and constructional praxis) were created. Cognitive changes as a function of the intervention were analyzed with multivariable mixed-effects models. Results: After the 1-year follow-up, 571 (89.1\%) controls and 573 (89.8\%) from the intervention group participated in the post-intervention assessment. Both control and intervention groups showed improvements in global cognition and in all cognitive domains after 1 year, but differences in cognitive changes between the two groups were not statistically significant. However, participants with higher adherence to the NU-AGE diet showed statistically significant improvements in global cognition [{$\beta$} 0.20 (95\%CI 0.004, 0.39), p-value = 0.046] and episodic memory [{$\beta$} 0.15 (95\%CI 0.02, 0.28), p-value = 0.025] after 1 year, compared to those adults with lower adherence. Discussion: High adherence to the culturally adapted, individually tailored, NU-AGE diet could slow down age-related cognitive decline, helping to prevent cognitive impairment and dementia.},

Recent research revealed that dopaminergic transmission within the fronto-striatal circuitry strongly modulates cost-benefit decision-making. Alterations within the dopaminergic fronto-striatal system have been associated with obesity, but little is known about cost-benefit decision-making differences in obese compared with lean individuals. With a newly developed experimental task we investigate obesity-associated alterations in cost-benefit decision-making, utilizing physical effort by handgrip-force exertion and both food and non-food rewards. We relate our behavioral findings to alterations in local gray matter volume assessed by structural MRI. Obese compared with lean subjects were less willing to engage in physical effort in particular for high-caloric sweet snack food. Further, self-reported body dissatisfaction negatively correlated with the willingness to invest effort for sweet snacks in obese men. On a structural level, obesity was associated with reductions in gray matter volume in bilateral prefrontal cortex. Nucleus accumbens volume positively correlated with task induced implicit food craving. Our results challenge the common notion that obese individuals are willing to work harder to obtain high-caloric food and emphasize the need for further exploration of the underlying neural mechanisms regarding cost-benefit decision-making differences in obesity.}

We measured baseline A{$\beta$} (using florbetapir-PET), brain function (using fluorodeoxyglucose-PET), and brain structure (using MRI). A mediation analysis was performed to test whether statistical effects of A{$\beta$} positivity on cross-sectional and longitudinal episodic memory were mediated by hypometabolism or regional gray matter volume in cognitively healthy controls (CN, n = 280) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI, n = 463).Results: Lower memory scores were associated with A{$\beta$} positivity (CN, mildly; MCI, strongly), smaller gray matter volumes (CN, few regions, including hippocampus; MCI, widespread), and hypometabolism. Smaller volumes and hypometabolism mediated effects of A{$\beta$} in MCI but not in CN. The strongest individual regions mediated up to approximately 25\%. A combination of brain structure and function mediated up to approximately 40\%. In several regions, gray matter atrophy and hypometabolism predicted episodic memory without being associated (at p \&amp;lt; 0.05) with A{$\beta$} positivity.Conclusions: Changes in brain structure and function appear to be, in part, downstream events from A{$\beta$} pathology, ultimately resulting in episodic memory deficits. However, A{$\beta$} pathology is also strongly related to memory deficits through mechanisms that are not quantified by these imaging measurements, and episodic memory decline is partly caused by Alzheimer disease{\textendash}like brain changes independently of A{$\beta$} pathology.A{$\beta$}={$\beta$}-amyloid; AD=Alzheimer disease; ADNI=Alzheimer\&\#039;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; AVLT=Auditory Verbal Learning Test; CN=cognitively healthy control; FDG=fluorodeoxyglucose; GM=gray matter; LM=Logical Memory; MCI=mild cognitive impairment; TDP-43=TAR DNA-binding protein 43}

The current study assessed the effects of a 6-month exercise intervention on intrinsic activity in the default mode network (DMN), a functionally connected network of brain regions including posterior cingulate cortex, cuneus/precuneus, medial prefrontal cortex, medial temporal lobe, and inferior parietal cortices, and salience network, which includes the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Resting-state functional MRI data were acquired in 12 overweight/obese individuals. The intervention was associated with a reduction in DMN activity in the precuneus (P=0.003, family-wise error-corrected), which was associated with greater fat mass loss (P=0.013) as well as reduced perceived hunger (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire, P=0.024) and hunger ratings in response to a meal (P=0.013). No changes were observed in the salience network in response to the exercise intervention. The association between DMN change and both fat mass loss and reduction of hunger ratings suggests that DMN function may be involved in the regulation of food intake behaviors. Given previous reports of DMN overactivity in overweight/obese individuals, the present findings may indicate an exercise-related 'normalization' of network function.},

  abstract = {Background: Non-demented cognitive aging trajectories are characterized by vast level and slope differences and a spectrum of outcomes, including dementia. Objective: The goal of AD risk management (and its corollary, promoting healthy brain aging) is aided by two converging objectives: 1) classifying dynamic distributions of non-demented cognitive trajectories, and 2) identifying modifiable risk-elevating and risk-reducing factors that discriminate stable or normal trajectory patterns from declining or pre-impairment patterns. Method: Using latent class growth analysis we classified three episodic memory aging trajectories for n = 882 older adults (baseline M age=71.6, SD =8.9, range = 53-95, female=66\%): Stable (SMA; above average level, sustained slope), Normal (NMA; average level, moderately declining slope), and Declining (DMA; below average level, substantially declining slope). Using random forest analyses, we simultaneously assessed 17 risk/protective factors from non-modifiable demographic, functional, psychological, and lifestyle domains. Within two age strata (Young-Old, Old-Old), three pairwise prediction analyses identified important discriminating factors. Results: Prediction analyses revealed that different modifiable risk predictors, both shared and unique across age strata, discriminated SMA (i.e., education, depressive symptoms, living status, body mass index, heart rate, social activity) and DMA (i.e., lifestyle activities [cognitive, self-maintenance, social], grip strength, heart rate, gait) groups. Conclusion: Memory trajectory analyses produced empirical classes varying in level and slope. Prediction analyses revealed different predictors of SMA and DMA that also varied by age strata. Precision approaches for promoting healthier memory aging{\textemdash}and delaying memory impairment{\textemdash}may identify modifiable factors that constitute specific targets for intervention in the differential context of age and non-demented trajectory patterns.},

As their total volume is variably associated with cognition, a new approach that integrates multiple radiological criteria is warranted. Location may matter, as periventricular WMHs have been shown to be associated with cognitive impairments. WMHs that appear as hypointense in T1-weighted images (T1w) may also indicate the most severe component of WMHs. We developed an automatic method that sub-classifies WMHs into four categories (periventricular/deep and T1w-hypointense/nonT1w-hypointense) using MRI data from 684 community-dwelling older adults from the Whitehall II study. To test if location and intensity information can impact cognition, we derived two general linear models using either overall or subdivided volumes. Results showed that periventricular T1w-hypointense WMHs were significantly associated with poorer performance in the trail making A (p~=~0.011), digit symbol (p~=~0.028) and digit coding (p~=~0.009) tests. We found no association between total WMH volume and cognition. These findings suggest that sub-classifying WMHs according to both location and intensity in T1w reveals specific associations with cognitive performance.},

Here, we examined whether FTO is associated with total brain volume in adolescence, thus exploring possible developmental effects of FTO. We studied a population-based sample of 598 adolescents recruited from the French Canadian founder population in whom we measured brain volume by magnetic resonance imaging. Total fat mass was assessed with bioimpedance and body mass index was determined with anthropometry. Genotype{\textendash}phenotype associations were tested with Merlin under an additive model. We found that the G allele of FTO (rs9930333) was associated with higher total body fat [TBF (P = 0.002) and lower brain volume (P = 0.005)]. The same allele was also associated with higher lean body mass (P = 0.03) and no difference in height (P = 0.99). Principal component analysis identified a shared inverse variance between the brain volume and TBF, which was associated with FTO at P = 5.5 {\texttimes} 10-6. These results were replicated in two independent samples of 413 and 718 adolescents, and in a meta-analysis of all three samples (n = 1729 adolescents), FTO was associated with this shared inverse variance at P = 1.3 {\texttimes} 10-9. Co-expression networks analysis supported the possibility that the underlying FTO effects may occur during embryogenesis. In conclusion, FTO is associated with shared inverse variance between body adiposity and brain volume, suggesting that this gene may exert inverse effects on adipose and brain tissues. Given the completion of the overall brain growth in early childhood, these effects may have their origins during early development.}

  author = {Meng, X. and D'Arcy, C.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Cognitive reserve (CR) or brain reserve capacity explains why individuals with higher IQ, education, or occupational attainment have lower risks of developing dementia, Alzheimer's disease (AD) or vascular dementia (VaD). The CR hypothesis postulates that CR reduces the prevalence and incidence of AD or VaD. It also hypothesizes that among those who have greater initial cognitive reserve (in contrast to those with less reserve) greater brain pathology occurs before the clinical symptoms of disease becomes manifest. Thus clinical disease onset triggers a faster decline in cognition and function, and increased mortality among those with initial greater cognitive reserve. Disease progression follows distinctly separate pathological and clinical paths. With education as a proxy we use meta-analyses and qualitative analyses to review the evidence for the CR hypothesis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We searched PubMed, PsycoINFO, EMBASE, HealthStar, and Scopus databases from January 1980 to June 2011 for observational studies with clear criteria for dementia, AD or VaD and education. One hundred and thirty-three articles with a variety of study designs met the inclusion criteria. Prevalence and incidence studies with odds ratios (ORs), relative risks or original data were included in the meta-analyses. Other studies were reviewed qualitatively. The studies covered 437,477 subjects. Prevalence and incidence studies with pooled ORs of 2.61 (95\%CI 2.21-3.07) and 1.88 (95\%CI 1.51-2.34) respectively, showed low education increased the risk of dementia. Heterogeneity and sensitivity tests confirmed the evidence. Generally, study characteristics had no effect on conclusions. Qualitative analyses also showed the protective effects of higher education on developing dementia and with clinical disease onset hastening a decline in cognition and function, and greater brain pathology. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: This systematic review and meta-analyses covering a wide range of observational studies and diverse settings provides robust support for the CR hypothesis. The CR hypothesis suggests several avenues for dementia prevention. FAU - Meng, Xiangfei},

  abstract = {The increase in overweight and obesity is a worldwide health problem. The first wave of the "German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Adults" (DEGS1), conducted from 2008 through 2011, provides current data about overweight and obesity among adults in Germany. Within DEGS1, a representative sample of the 18- to 79-year-old population was interviewed with regard to health relevant issues and physically examined (n = 7,116). From measurements of body height and weight, the body mass index (BMI) was calculated, which was used to define overweight (BMI {$>$}/= 25 kg/m(2)) and obesity (BMI {$>$}/= 30 kg/m(2)). Results are stratified for gender, age group, socioeconomic status and region and compared with results from the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey 1998 (GNHIES98) and the National Examination Surveys 1990/92. According to DEGS1, 67.1\% of men and 53.0\% of women are overweight. The prevalence of overweight has not changed compared to GNHIES98. The prevalence of obesity, however, has risen substantially, especially among men: in GNHIES98, 18.9\% of men and 22.5\% of women were obese, in DEGS1, these figures were 23.3\% and 23.9\%, respectively. The increase in obesity occurred especially among young adults. An English full-text version of this article is available at SpringerLink as supplemental. FAU - Mensink, G B M},

The lysis is inhibited by transforming growth factor-beta, antagonists of nitric oxide (NO) production, as well as antibodies to TNF-alpha, intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), and leukocyte functional Ag-1. Ameboid microglial cells spontaneously produce detectable levels of the NO metabolite nitrite (NO2-). Stimuli such as PMA, LPS, and/or IFN-gamma induce micromolar concentrations of NO2- within 24 h. TNF-alpha increases IFN gamma but not LPS-induced NO2- production. Incubation with target oligodendrocytes also increases NO2- production in a contact-dependent manner. NO2- production is inhibited by NO synthase antagonists, transforming growth factor-beta, and anti TNF-alpha. Neither antileukocyte functional Ag-1 nor anti-ICAM-1 inhibit NO2- production by microglia in the presence or absence of oligodendrocytes. Indeed, anti-ICAM-1 treatment increases NO2- production. There is a correlation between ameboid microglial cell killing of oligodendrocytes and NO2- production suggesting NO may be a mechanism of death of the oligodendrocyte and possibly play a role in lesion formation in multiple sclerosis.

Cognitive problems are not resolved by a sequential and hierarchical progression toward predetermined goals but instead by a simultaneous and interactive consideration of multiple possibilities and constraints until a satisfactory fit is achieved. The resultant texture of mental activity is characterized by almost infinite richness and flexibility. According to this model, complex behavior is mapped at the level of multifocal neural systems rather than specific anatomical sites, giving rise to brain?behavior relationships that are both localized and distributed. Each network contains anatomically addressed channels for transferring information content and chemically addressed pathways for modulating behavioral tone. This approach provides a blueprint for reexploring the neurological foundations of attention, language, memory, and frontal lobe function.}

  abstract = {The idea that specific kind of foods may have an addiction potential and that some forms of overeating may represent an addicted behavior has been discussed for decades. In recent years, the interest in food addiction is growing and research on this topic lead to more precise definitions and assessment methods. For example, the Yale Food Addiction Scale has been developed for the measurement of addiction-like eating behavior based on the diagnostic criteria for substance dependence of the fourth revision of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV). In 2013, diagnostic criteria for substance abuse and{\textemdash}dependence were merged, thereby increasing the number of symptoms for substance use disorders (SUDs) in the DSM-5. Moreover, gambling disorder is now included along SUDs as a behavioral addiction. Although a plethora of review articles exist that discuss the applicability of the DSM-IV substance dependence criteria to eating behavior, the transferability of the newly added criteria to eating is unknown. Thus, the current article discusses if and how these new criteria may be translated to overeating. Furthermore, it is examined if the new SUD criteria will impact future research on food addiction, for example, if ``diagnosing'' food addiction should also be adapted by considering all of the new symptoms. Given the critical response to the revisions in DSM-5, we also discuss if the recent approach of Research Domain Criteria can be helpful in evaluating the concept of food addiction.},

It remains to be examined if bariatric surgery induces structural brain changes. The aim of this study is to characterize GM and WM density changes in a longitudinal setting, comparing pre- and post-operation and to determine whether these changes are related to inflammation and cardiometabolic markers.Methods 29 severely obese participants (age: 45.9{$\pm$}7.8 years) scheduled to undergo sleeve gastrectomy (SG) were recruited. High-resolution T1-weighted anatomical images were acquired 1 month prior to as well as 4 and 12 months after surgery. GM and WM densities were quantified using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Circulating lipid profile, glucose, insulin and inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and lipopolysaccharide-binding protein (LBP) were measured at each time point. A linear mixed effect model was used to compare brain changes before and after SG, controlling for age, gender, initial BMI and diabetic status. To assess the associations between changes in adiposity, metabolism and inflammation and changes in GM or WM density, the mean GM and WM densities were extracted across all the participants using atlas, and linear mixed-effect models were used.Results As expected, weight, BMI, waist circumference and neck circumference significantly decreased after SG compared with baseline (p\&amp;lt;0.001 for all). A widespread increase in WM density was observed after surgery, particularly in the cerebellum, brain stem, cerebellar peduncle, cingulum, corpus callosum and corona radiata (p\&amp;lt;0.05, after FDR correction). Significant increases in GM density were observed 4 months after SG compared to baseline in several brain regions such as the bilateral occipital cortex, temporal cortex, precentral gyrus and cerebellum as well as right fusiform gyrus, right hippocampus and right insula. These GM and WM increases were more pronounced and widespread after 12 months and were significantly associated with post-operative weight loss and the improvement of metabolic alterations. Our linear mixed-effect models also showed strong associations between post-operative reductions in LBP, a marker of inflammation, and increased WM density. To confirm our results, we tested whether the peak of each significant region showed BMI-related differences in an independent dataset (Human Connectome Project). We matched a group of severely obese individuals with a group of lean individuals for age, gender and ethnicity. Severe obesity was associated with reduced WM density in the brain stem and cerebellar peduncle as well as reduced GM density in cerebellum, regions that significantly changed after surgery (p\&amp;lt;0.01 for all clusters).Conclusions Bariatric surgery-induced weight loss and improvement in metabolic alterations is associated with widespread increases in WM and GM densities. These post-operative changes overlapped with baseline brain differences between severely obese and normal-weight individuals, which may suggest a recovery of WM and GM alterations after bariatric surgery.}

  abstract = {Impulsivity refers to a tendency to act rapidly without full consideration of consequences. The trait is thought to result from the interaction between high arousal responses to potential rewards and poor self-control. Studies have suggested that impulsivity confers vulnerability to both addiction and obesity. However, results in this area are unclear, perhaps due to the high phenotypic complexity of addictions and obesity. Focusing on impulsivity, the aim of this review is to tackle the putative overlaps between addiction and obesity in four domains: (1) personality research, (2) neurocognitive tasks, (3) brain imaging, and (4) clinical evidence. We suggest that three impulsivity-related domains are particularly relevant for our understanding of similarities between addiction and obesity: lower self-control (high Disinhibition/low Conscientiousness), reward sensitivity (high Extraversion/Positive Emotionality), and negative affect (high Neuroticism/Negative Emotionality). Neurocognitive studies have shown that obesity and addiction are both associated with increased impulsive decision-making and attention bias in response to drug or food cues, respectively. Mirroring this, obesity and different forms of addiction seem to exhibit similar alterations in functional MRI brain activity in response to reward processing and during self-control tasks. Overall, our review provides an integrative approach to understand those facets of obesity that present similarities to addictive behaviors. In addition, we suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting inhibitory control may represent a promising approach for the prevention and/or treatment of obesity.}

First, 66 patients with probable Alzheimer's disease with a spectrum of dementia severity (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 0-23) were recruited and studied. Cortical metabolic activity was analyzed topographically using three-dimensional stereotactic surface projections. Regression analysis was performed for each brain pixel to predict metabolic patterns of very early disease. Predictions were tested prospectively in a group of 8 patients who complained only of memory impairment without general cognitive decline (Mini-Mental State Examination score, 25 +/- 1) at the time of scanning but whose condition later progressed to probable Alzheimer's disease. Both results were compared to cerebral metabolic activity in 22 age-similar normal control subjects. Prediction and analysis of actual patients consistently indicated marked metabolic reduction (21-22\%) in the posterior cingulate cortex and cinguloparietal transitional area in patients with very early Alzheimer's disease. Mean metabolic reduction in the posterior cingulate cortex was significantly greater than that in the lateral neocortices or parahippocampal cortex. The result suggests a functional importance for the posterior cingulate cortex in impairment of learning and memory, which is a feature of very early Alzheimer's disease.},

  abstract = {More than one-third of adults in the United States are obese, with a higher prevalence among older adults. Obesity among older adults is a major cause of physical dysfunction, hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart diseases. Many people who engage in lifestyle weight loss interventions fail to reach targeted goals for weight loss, and most will regain what was lost within 1-2 years following cessation of treatment. This variability in treatment efficacy suggests that there are important phenotypes predictive of success with intentional weight loss that could lead to tailored treatment regimen, an idea that is consistent with the concept of precision-based medicine. Although the identification of biochemical and metabolic phenotypes are one potential direction of research, neurobiological measures may prove useful as substantial behavioral change is necessary to achieve success in a lifestyle intervention. In the present study, we use dynamic brain networks from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data to prospectively identify individuals most likely to succeed in a behavioral weight loss intervention. Brain imaging was performed in overweight or obese older adults (age: 65-79 years) who participated in an 18-month lifestyle weight loss intervention. Machine learning and functional brain networks were combined to produce multivariate prediction models. The prediction accuracy exceeded 95\%, suggesting that there exists a consistent pattern of connectivity which correctly predicts success with weight loss at the individual level. Connectivity patterns that contributed to the prediction consisted of complex multivariate network components that substantially overlapped with known brain networks that are associated with behavior emergence, self-regulation, body awareness, and the sensory features of food. Future work on independent datasets and diverse populations is needed to corroborate our findings. Additionally, we believe that efforts can begin to examine whether these models have clinical utility in tailoring treatment.},

Pairwise correlations were assessed using product-moment correlation, and regression analysis was used to evaluate relationships between leptin and other variables.Leptin concentrations and relative body fat content were correlated in young females (r = 0.71; P = 0.009) and in young males (r = 0.76; P = 0.007), but not in the combined middle-aged and elderly groups (r = 0.19; P = 0.36 and r = 0.19; P = 0.38 in females and males, respectively). Regression analysis showed a clear correlation between circulating leptin and relative fat mass in the young subjects (P = 0.0001), but not in the older subjects (P = 0.199).We conclude that body fat content in young subjects correlates with plasma leptin in both genders, whereas this relationship is disrupted in elderly subjects, thus possibly contributing to the obesity occurring with age.}

The present magnetic resonance imaging study aims to compare the organization of gray matter structural covariance networks between 109 cognitively unimpaired controls (CTRL) and 109 AD patients positive to beta-amyloid at the early stages of the disease, using voxel-based morphometry. The default-mode network (DMN; medial temporal lobe subsystem) was less extended in AD patients in comparison with CTRL, with a significant decrease in the structural association between the entorhinal cortex and the medial prefrontal and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. The DMN (midline core subsystem) was also less extended in AD patients. Trends toward increased structural association were observed in the salience and executive control networks. The observed changes suggest that early disruptions in structural association between heteromodal association cortices and the entorhinal cortex could contribute to an isolation of the hippocampal formation, potentially giving rise to the clinical hallmark of AD, progressive memory impairment. It also provides critical support to the hypothesis that the reduced connectivity within the DMN in early AD is accompanied by an enhancement of connectivity in the salience and executive control networks.}

WMH volume was obtained by an automated segmentation algorithm. Baseline WMH volumes and change between baseline and follow-up WMH were related to cognitive scores over time using mixed-effect linear regressions. Secondary stratified analyses according to Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) status, APOE4 status, and presence of amyloid in the brain were conducted using similar regression models. Change in WMH volume overtime was associated with declines in COWAT ({$\beta$}=-0.239; 95\% CI=-0.381, -0.096, p=0.001). Baseline WMH was not associated to any of the cognitive tests. Secondary analysis found that baseline WMH was associated to declines in TMT-A in APOE4 non-carriers ({$\beta$}=0.343; 95\% CI=0.121, 0.564, p=0.003) and CDR 0 groups ({$\beta$}=0.307; 95\% CI=0.095, 0.519, p=0.005); in CDR 0 group, overtime changes in WMH was associated to declines on both TMT-A ({$\beta$}=0.698; 95\% CI=0.270, 1.126, p=0.002) and TMT-B ({$\beta$}=2.573; 95\% CI=1.200, 3.947, p{$<$}0.001). Changes in WMH volume are associated with declines in information processing speed and executive function in non-demented older adults with memory complaints.

  abstract = {Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a transitional stage between age-related cognitive decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD). For the effective treatment of AD, it would be important to identify MCI patients at high risk for conversion to AD. In this study, we present a novel magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based method for predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion from one to three years before the clinical diagnosis. First, we developed a novel MRI biomarker of MCI-to-AD conversion using semi-supervised learning and then integrated it with age and cognitive measures about the subjects using a supervised learning algorithm resulting in what we call the aggregate biomarker. The novel characteristics of the methods for learning the biomarkers are as follows: 1) We used a semi-supervised learning method (low density separation) for the construction of MRI biomarker as opposed to more typical supervised methods; 2) We performed a feature selection on MRI data from AD subjects and normal controls without using data from MCI subjects via regularized logistic regression; 3) We removed the aging effects from the MRI data before the classifier training to prevent possible confounding between AD and age related atrophies; and 4) We constructed the aggregate biomarker by first learning a separate MRI biomarker and then combining it with age and cognitive measures about the MCI subjects at the baseline by applying a random forest classifier. We experimentally demonstrated the added value of these novel characteristics in predicting the MCI-to-AD conversion on data obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. With the ADNI data, the MRI biomarker achieved a 10-fold cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.7661 in discriminating progressive MCI patients (pMCI) from stable MCI patients (sMCI). Our aggregate biomarker based on MRI data together with baseline cognitive measurements and age achieved a 10-fold cross-validated AUC score of 0.9020 in discriminating pMCI from sMCI. The results presented in this study demonstrate the potential of the suggested approach for early AD diagnosis and an important role of MRI in the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction. However, it is evident based on our results that combining MRI data with cognitive test results improved the accuracy of the MCI-to-AD conversion prediction.},

  abstract = {Abstract Adolescent alcohol use is associated with increased risk for alcohol use disorders later in life; therefore, identifying biomarkers for initiation of heavy alcohol use, such as individual differences in the development of white-matter microstructure, may inform prevention strategies that improve public health. This prospective cohort study included 40 adolescents, ages 14 and 15, without substantial history of alcohol or drug use at baseline. Fractional anisotropy (FA), an index of white-matter microstructure, was assessed in pathways connecting the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) to the rest of the brain using diffusion tensor imaging. Path analyses were conducted voxel-wise within these pathways to examine direct effects of premorbid FA on number of months between baseline assessment and the onset of binge drinking and indirect effects mediated by NAcc activation during decision making assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Adolescents with lower premorbid accumbofrontal FA began binge drinking sooner, an effect which was mediated by greater NAcc activation during decision making involving greater levels of risk and reward (P~{$<~$}.05 corrected). An additional direct effect of FA on duration to onset of binge drinking was observed in white matter near the ventral pallidum, as adolescents with lower premorbid FA in this region began binge drinking sooner (P~{$<~$}.05 corrected). Findings suggest that delayed maturation of prefrontal white~matter is associated with less top-down control over striatal sensitivity to reward. These factors, along with individual differences in white matter proximal to ventral pallidum, may represent premorbid risk factors for earlier initiation of heavy alcohol use.},

  abstract = {Objective: Our objective was to investigate whether type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) influences neurodegeneration in a manner similar to Alzheimer disease (AD), by promoting brain {$\beta$}-amyloid (A{$\beta$}) or tau.Methods: We studied the cross-sectional associations of T2DM with cortical thickness, brain A{$\beta$} load, and CSF levels of A{$\beta$} and tau in a sample of people from the Alzheimer\&\#039;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative with diagnoses of AD dementia, mild cognitive impairment, and normal cognition. All (n = 816) received MRI, and a subsample underwent brain amyloid imaging (n = 102) and CSF A{$\beta$} and tau measurements (n = 415). Analyses were performed across and within cognitive diagnostic strata.Results: There were 124 people with T2DM (mean age 75.5 years) and 692 without T2DM (mean age 74.1 years). After adjusting for age, sex, total intracranial volume, APO {$\epsilon$}4 status, and cognitive diagnosis, T2DM was associated with lower bilateral frontal and parietal cortical thickness (mL) ({$\beta$} = -0.03, p = 0.01). T2DM was not associated with 11C Pittsburgh compound B standardized uptake value ratio (AU) in any brain region or with CSF A{$\beta$}42 levels (pg/mL). T2DM was associated with greater CSF total tau (pg/mL) ({$\beta$} = 16.06, p = 0.04) and phosphorylated tau ({$\beta$} = 5.84, p = 0.02). The association between T2DM and cortical thickness was attenuated by 15\% by the inclusion of phosphorylated tau.Conclusions: T2DM may promote neurodegeneration independent of AD dementia diagnosis, and its effect may be driven by tau phosphorylation. The mechanisms through which T2DM may promote tau phosphorylation deserve further study.A{$\beta$}={$\beta$}-amyloid; AD=Alzheimer disease; ADNI=Alzheimer\&\#039;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; CI=confidence interval; MCI=mild cognitive impairment; NC=normal control; PiB=Pittsburgh compound B; p-tau=phosphorylated tau; SUVR=standardized uptake value ratio; T2DM=type 2 diabetes mellitus; VBM=voxel-based morphometry; WMH=white matter hyperintensity}

It remains unclear if sex differences influence WMH progression or the relationship between WMH and cognition. METHODS Linear mixed models examined the relationship between risk factors, WMHs, and cognition in males and females. RESULTS Males exhibited increased WMH progression in occipital, but lower progression in frontal, total, and deep than females. For males, history of hypertension was the strongest contributor, while in females, the vascular composite was the strongest contributor to WMH burden. WMH burden was more strongly associated with decreases in global cognition, executive functioning, memory, and functional activities in females than males. DISCUSSION Controlling vascular risk factors may reduce WMH in both males and females. For males, targeting hypertension may be most important to reduce WMHs. The results have implications for therapies/interventions targeting cerebrovascular pathology and subsequent cognitive decline. HIGHLIGHTS Hypertension is the main vascular risk factor associated with WMH in males A combination of vascular risk factors contributes to WMH burden in females Only small WMH burden differences were observed between sexes Females' cognition was more negatively impacted by WMH burden than males Females with WMHs may have less resilience to future pathology},

These have been related to frontal hemispheric asymmetries in clinical and resting-state EEG studies: Approach was linked to higher activity of the left relative to the right hemisphere, while avoidance was related to the opposite pattern. Increased approach behaviour, specifically towards unhealthy foods, is also observed in obesity and has been linked to asymmetry in the framework of the right-brain hypothesis of obesity. Here, we aimed to replicate previous EEG findings of hemispheric asymmetries for self-reported approach/avoidance behaviour and to relate them to eating behaviour. Further, we assessed whether resting fMRI hemispheric asymmetries can be detected and whether they are related to approach/avoidance, eating behaviour and BMI. We analysed three samples: Sample 1 (n = 117) containing EEG and fMRI data from lean participants, and Samples 2 (n = 89) and 3 (n = 152) containing fMRI data from lean, overweight and obese participants. In Sample 1, approach behaviour in women was related to EEG, but not to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. In Sample 2, approach/avoidance behaviours were related to fMRI hemispheric asymmetries. Finally, hemispheric asymmetries were not related to either BMI or eating behaviour in any of the samples. Our study partly replicates previous EEG findings regarding hemispheric asymmetries and indicates that this relationship could also be captured using fMRI. Our findings suggest that eating behaviour and obesity are likely to be mediated by mechanisms not directly relating to frontal asymmetries in neuronal activation quantified with EEG and fMRI.},

  abstract = {Chronic obesity is associated with several complications, including cognitive impairment and dementia. However, we have piecemeal knowledge of the mechanisms linking obesity to central nervous system damage. Adiposity leads to the metabolic syndrome, consisting of inflammation, hypertension, dyslipidemia and insulin resistance. In turn, these metabolic abnormalities cause cerebrovascular dysfunction, which may cause white and grey matter tissue loss and consequent cognitive impairment. While there have been several neuroimaging studies linking adiposity to changes in brain morphometry, a comprehensive investigation of the relationship has so far not been done. Here we use structural equation modelling applied to over 15,000 individuals from the UK Biobank to identify the causal chain that links adiposity to cognitive dysfunction. We found that body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio were positively related to higher plasma C-reactive protein, dyslipidemia, occurrence of hypertension and diabetes, all of which were in turn related to cerebrovascular disease as measured by volume of white matter hyperintensities on magnetic resonance imaging. White mater hyperintensities were associated with lower cortical thickness and volume and higher subcortical volumes, which were associated with cognitive deficits on tests of visuospatial memory, fluid intelligence, and working memory among others. In follow-up analyses we found that inflammation, hypertension and diabetes mediated 20\% of the relationship between obesity and cerebrovascular disease and that cerebrovascular disease mediated a significant proportion of the relationship between obesity and cortical thickness and volume. We also showed that volume of white matter hyperintensities was related to decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in the majority of white matter tracts, pointing to white matter dysconnectivity as a major cause of impaired cognition. Our results have clinical implications, supporting a role for the management of adiposity in the prevention of late-life dementia and cognitive decline.Competing Interest StatementThe authors have declared no competing interest.}

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) volumetric measures have become a standard tool for the detection of incipient Alzheimer's Disease (AD) dementia in mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Focused on providing an earlier and more accurate diagnosis, sophisticated MRI machine learning algorithms have been developed over the recent years, most of them learning their non-disease patterns from MCI that remained stable over 2{\textendash}3\,years. In this work, we analyzed whether these stable MCI over short-term periods are actually appropriate training examples of non-disease patterns. To this aim, we compared the diagnosis of MCI patients at 2 and 5\,years of follow-up and investigated its impact on the predictive performance of baseline volumetric MRI measures primarily involved in AD, i.e., hippocampal and entorhinal cortex volumes. Predictive power was evaluated in terms of the area under the ROC curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in a trial sample of 248 MCI patients followed-up over 5\,years. We further compared the sensitivity in those MCI that converted before 2\,years and those that converted after 2\,years. Our results indicate that 23\% of the stable MCI at 2\,years progressed in the next three years and that MRI volumetric measures are good predictors of conversion to AD dementia even at the mid-term, showing a better specificity and AUC as follow-up time increases. The combination of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex yielded an AUC that was significantly higher for the 5-year follow-up (AUC\,=\,73\% at 2\,years vs. AUC\,=\,84\% at 5\,years), as well as for specificity (56\% vs. 71\%). Sensitivity showed a non-significant slight decrease (81\% vs. 78\%). Remarkably, the performance of this model was comparable to machine learning models at the same follow-up times. MRI correctly identified most of the patients that converted after 2\,years (with sensitivity {$>$}60\%), and these patients showed a similar degree of abnormalities to those that converted before 2\,years. This implies that most of the MCI patients that remained stable over short periods and subsequently progressed to AD dementia had evident atrophies at baseline. Therefore, machine learning models that use these patients to learn non-disease patterns are including an important fraction of patients with evident pathological changes related to the disease, something that might result in reduced performance and lack of biological interpretability.},

  abstract = {The association between white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and amyloid accumulation over time in cognitively normal, amyloid-negative elderly people remains largely unexplored. In order to study whether baseline WMH were associated with longitudinal subthreshold amyloid accumulation, 159 cognitively normal participants from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative who were amyloid-negative at baseline were examined. All the participants underwent a T1 and a Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery MRI scan at baseline. Amyloid PET imaging was performed at baseline and follow-up visits in 2-year intervals for up to 8 years. Partial volume correction was applied for quantifying cortical Standardised Uptake Value Ratios (SUVR). The associations between global and regional WMH burden and amyloid accumulation were assessed using linear mixed models adjusted by demographic characteristics and baseline SUVR. Partial volume correction increased the measured annual rate of change (+2.4\%) compared to that obtained from non-corrected data (+0.5\%). There were no significant correlations between baseline WMHs and baseline subthreshold cortical amyloid uptake. In a longitudinal analysis, increased baseline cortical SUVR and increased baseline burden of global (p~\hspace{0pt}=~\hspace{0pt}0.006), frontal (p~\hspace{0pt}=~\hspace{0pt}0.006), and parietal WMH (p~\hspace{0pt}=~\hspace{0pt}0.003) were associated with faster amyloid accumulation. WMH-related amyloid accumulation occurred in parietal, frontal, and, to a lesser extent, cingulate cortices. These results remained unchanged after a sensitivity analysis excluding participants with the highest cortical SUVRs. This is the first study to identify a specific spatial distribution of WMH which is associated with future amyloid accumulation in cognitively normal elderly subjects without PET-detectable amyloid pathology. These findings may have important implications in prevention trials for the early identification of amyloid accumulation.}

  abstract = {Cognitive aging is accompanied by a range of structural and functional differences in the brain, even in the absence of neurodegenerative disease. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have reported increased bilateral activation during task performance in elderly participants compared to their younger counterparts, particularly in frontal regions. Alterations have also been observed in the functional architecture of the resting brain, suggesting that aging is associated with changes in the organization of the networks of the brain. However, previous studies have largely focused on the default mode network, and little is known about the effects of age on other resting state-networks (RSNs). The aim of the present study was to investigate age-differences in resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) using fMRI data obtained during rest from 238 healthy participants aged 21-80 years. Using independent component analysis (ICA) and dual-regression, the results revealed age-related increases in RSFC across a range of RSNs, including task-positive networks in frontal and parietal regions. In contrast, age-related reductions in the default mode network and occipital visual networks were observed. Furthermore, whereas the effects of age on the various RSNs were found independent of age-related decreases in gray matter volume, sex and subject motion, we report strong positive and widespread effects of estimated subject motion on the RSFC across RSNs. The results provide support for the notion of network-specific effects in aging, manifested as increased tonic activation of task-positive networks, supporting higher-order cognitive functions and cognitive control, along with reduced task-negative default mode network and sensory visual networks during rest. The present results also corroborate recent evidence of strong influence of subject motion on estimated functional connectivity measures and strongly suggest that studies using RSFC measures as imaging phenotypes should adjust for individual differences in in-scanner subject motion.},

  abstract = {Several studies have shown that obesity is associated with changes in human brain function and structure. Since women are more susceptible to obesity than men, it seems plausible that neural correlates may also be different. However, this has not been demonstrated so far. To address this issue, we systematically investigated the brain's white matter (WM) structure in 23 lean to obese women (mean age 25.5 y, std 5.1 y; mean body mass index (BMI) 29.5 kg/m(2), std 7.3 kg/m(2)) and 26 lean to obese men (mean age 27.1 y, std 5.0 y; mean BMI 28.8 kg/m(2), std 6.8 kg/m(2)) with diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). There was no significant age (p{$>$}0.2) or BMI (p{$>$}0.7) difference between female and male participants. Using tract-based spatial statistics, we correlated several diffusion parameters including the apparent diffusion coefficient, fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as axial (lambda( parallel)) and radial diffusivity (lambda( perpendicular)) with BMI and serum leptin levels. In female and male subjects, the putative axon marker lambda( parallel) was consistently reduced throughout the corpus callosum, particularly in the splenium (r = -0.62, p{$<$}0.005). This suggests that obesity may be associated with axonal degeneration. Only in women, the putative myelin marker lambda( perpendicular) significantly increased with increasing BMI (r = 0.57, p{$<$}0.005) and serum leptin levels (r = 0.62, p{$<$}0.005) predominantly in the genu of the corpus callosum, suggesting additional myelin degeneration. Comparable structural changes were reported for the aging brain, which may point to accelerated aging of WM structure in obese subjects. In conclusion, we demonstrate structural WM changes related to an elevated body weight, but with differences between men and women. Future studies on obesity-related functional and structural brain changes should therefore account for sex-related differences. FAU - Mueller, Karsten},

Individuals heterozygous for one of these mutations become obese while young. We now investigate whether common non-coding variation near MC4R also contributes to obesity. Fifty-six tag single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 3,229 full-heritage Pima Indians, and nine of these SNPs which showed evidence for association were genotyped in additional 3,852 mixed-heritage American Indians. Associations of SNPs with maximum body mass index (BMI) in adulthood (n~=~5,918), BMI z score in childhood (n~=~5,350), percent body fat (n~=~864), energy expenditure (n~=~358) and ad libitum food intake (n~=~178) were assessed. Conditional analyses demonstrated that SNPs, rs74861148 and rs483125, were independently associated with BMI in adulthood ({$\beta~$}=~0.68~kg/m(2) per risk allele, p~=~5~{\texttimes}~10(-5); {$\beta~$}=~0.58~kg/m(2), p~=~0.002, respectively) and BMI z score in childhood ({$\beta~$}=~0.05, p~=~0.02; {$\beta~$}=~0.07, p~=~0.01, respectively). One haplotype (frequency~=~0.35) of the G allele at rs74861148 and the A allele at rs483125 provided the strongest evidence for association with adult BMI ({$\beta~$}=~0.89~kg/m(2), p~=~5.5~{\texttimes}~10(-7)), and was also associated with childhood BMI z score ({$\beta~$}=~0.08, p~=~0.001). In addition, a promoter SNP rs11872992 was nominally associated with adult BMI ({$\beta~$}=~0.61~kg/m(2), p~=~0.05) and childhood BMI z score ({$\beta~$}=~0.11, p~=~0.01), where the risk allele also modestly decreased transcription in vitro by 12~\% (p~=~0.005). This risk allele was further associated with increased percent body fat ({$\beta~$}=~2.2~\%, p~=~0.002), increased food intake ({$\beta~$}=~676~kcal/day, p~=~0.007) and decreased energy expenditure ({$\beta~$}=~-53.4~kcal/day, p~=~0.054).

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION:: Many studies have investigated the association of the dopamine type-2 receptor (DRD2) Taq1A polymorphism with tobacco use and cigarette smoking behaviors, but findings remain equivocal. There is a biological basis for considering that this association differs by sex, and differences in subpopulations might explain some of the contradictory evidence. METHODS:: Our a priori hypothesis was that the association of the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism with smoking behavior would be more prominent in females than males. We therefore investigated the strength of evidence for an association between the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism and smoking behavior in a large sample of females and used meta-analytic techniques to synthesize existing published data and explore the role of sex in explaining any heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS:: We did not observe any strong evidence of association between the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism and smoking behavior, including smoking initiation, smoking persistence, and smoking rate, either in our female sample or in our meta-analysis of 29 studies, comprising 28 published studies and the data from the present study. Metaregression suggested an association between the proportion of male participants in a study and the individual study effect size, indicating a larger effect size with a greater proportion of male participants for smoking initiation and smoking persistence. This effect did not appear to be due to the inclusion of the data from the present study. DISCUSSION:: Available evidence does not support an association between the DRD2 Taq1A polymorphism and smoking behavior. Contrary to our a priori hypothesis, we found evidence of a stronger association in males than in females.}

  abstract = {Objective: To examine how baseline and change of volumetric MRI relate to cognitive decline in older individuals. Background: Memory is associated with hippocampal integrity, whereas executive function has been linked to impaired frontal lobe function. Previous studies have shown that hippocampal and cortical atrophy are more strongly related to cognition than are measures of subcortical cerebrovascular disease (CVD). The authors hypothesized that memory (MEM) decline would be related to change in hippocampal volume (HC), whereas decline in executive function (EXEC) would be related to change of cortical gray matter volume (CGM) and measures of subcortical CVD. Methods: Subjects from a multicenter study (n = 103) included cognitively normal, mildly impaired, and demented cases with and without subcortical lacunes. All had longitudinal cognitive evaluation (mean = 4.8 years) and two or more MRI scans at least one year apart (mean = 3.4 years). MRI measures included HC, CGM, total lacune volume (LAC), and white matter hyperintensity volume (WMH). Random effects modeling of longitudinal data assessed effects of MRI baseline and MRI change on baseline and change of psychometrically matched measures of MEM and EXEC. Results: Change in MEM was related to HC baseline and HC change. Change in EXEC was related to baseline CGM and to change in CGM, HC, and LAC. Results were unchanged when demented cases were excluded. WMH was not associated with change in MEM or EXEC independent of HC, CGM, and LAC. Conclusion: Hippocampal volume was the primary determinant of memory decline, whereas executive function (EXEC) decline was related to multiple brain components. Results support a hypothesis that MEM decline is strongly influenced by Alzheimer disease (AD), whereas EXEC decline may be complexly determined by cerebrovascular disease and AD.}

LCAT and CETP are also crucial factors in HDL remodeling, a process by which HDL particles with a high capacity for cell cholesterol uptake are generated in plasma. In the present study, cholesterol esterification and transfer were evaluated in 60 patients with isolated hypercholesterolemia (HC, n=20) and isolated (HTG, n=20) or mixed hypertriglyceridemia (MHTG, n=20) and in 20 normolipidemic healthy individuals (NL). Cholesterol esterification rate (CER) and net CE transfer rate (CETR) were measured in whole plasma. LCAT and CETP concentrations were determined by specific immunoassays. HDL remodeling was analyzed by monitoring changes in HDL particle size distribution during incubation of whole plasma at 37{$^\circ$}C. Mean CER and CETR were 48\% and 73\% higher, respectively, in hypertriglyceridemic (HTG+MHTG) versus normotriglyceridemic individuals. HDL remodeling was also significantly accelerated in plasma from hypertriglyceridemic patients. Strong positive correlations were found in the total sample between plasma and VLDL triglyceride levels and CER (r=.722 and r=.642, respectively), CETR (r=.510 and r=.491, respectively), and HDL remodeling (r=.625 and r=.620, respectively). No differences in plasma LCAT and CETP concentrations were found among the various groups except for a tendency toward higher CETP levels in hypercholesterolemic patients (+51\% in MHTG and +20\% in HC) versus control subjects (NL). By stepwise regression analysis, VLDL triglyceride level was the sole significant predictor of CER and CETR and contributed significantly together with baseline HDL particle distribution to HDL remodeling. These results indicate that plasma triglyceride level is a major factor in the regulation of cholesterol esterification/transfer and HDL remodeling in human plasma, whereas LCAT/CETP concentrations play a minor role in the modulation of reverse cholesterol transport.}

  abstract = {Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a risk factor for Alzheimer disease (AD). Populations at risk for AD show altered brain activity in the default mode network (DMN) before cognitive dysfunction. We evaluated this brain pattern in T2DM patients. We compared T2DM patients (n = 10, age = 56 +/- 2.2 years, fasting plasma glucose [FPG] = 8.4 +/- 1.3 mmol/L, HbA(1c) = 7.5 +/- 0.54\%) with nondiabetic age-matched control subjects (n = 11, age = 54 +/- 1.8 years, FPG = 4.8 +/- 0.2 mmol/L) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to evaluate functional connectivity strength among DMN regions. We also evaluated hippocampal volume, cognition, and insulin sensitivity by homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Control subjects showed stronger correlations versus T2DM patients in the DMN between the seed (posterior cingulate) and bilateral middle temporal gyrus (beta = 0.67 vs. 0.43), the right inferior and left medial frontal gyri (beta = 0.75 vs. 0.54), and the left thalamus (beta = 0.59 vs. 0.37), respectively, with no group differences in cognition or hippocampal size. In T2DM patients, HOMA-IR was inversely correlated with functional connectivity in the right inferior frontal gyrus and precuneus. T2DM patients showed reduced functional connectivity in the DMN compared with control subjects, which was associated with insulin resistance in selected brain regions, but there were no group effects of brain structure or cognition.

  abstract = {Importance: The effect of intensive blood pressure lowering on brain health remains uncertain. Objective: To evaluate the association of intensive blood pressure treatment with cerebral white matter lesion and brain volumes. Design, Setting, and Participants: A substudy of a multicenter randomized clinical trial of hypertensive adults 50 years or older without a history of diabetes or stroke at 27 sites in the United States. Randomization began on November 8, 2010. The overall trial was stopped early because of benefit for its primary outcome (a composite of cardiovascular events) and all-cause mortality on August 20, 2015. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed on a subset of participants at baseline (n = 670) and at 4 years of follow-up (n = 449); final follow-up date was July 1, 2016. Interventions: Participants were randomized to a systolic blood pressure (SBP) goal of either less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment, n = 355) or less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment, n = 315). Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was change in total white matter lesion volume from baseline. Change in total brain volume was a secondary outcome. Results: Among 670 recruited patients who had baseline MRI (mean age, 67.3 [SD, 8.2] years; 40.4\% women), 449 (67.0\%) completed the follow-up MRI at a median of 3.97 years after randomization, after a median intervention period of 3.40 years. In the intensive treatment group, based on a robust linear mixed model, mean white matter lesion volume increased from 4.57 to 5.49 cm3 (difference, 0.92 cm3 [95\% CI, 0.69 to 1.14]) vs an increase from 4.40 to 5.85 cm3 (difference, 1.45 cm3 [95\% CI, 1.21 to 1.70]) in the standard treatment group (between-group difference in change, -0.54 cm3 [95\% CI, -0.87 to -0.20]). Mean total brain volume decreased from 1134.5 to 1104.0 cm3 (difference, -30.6 cm3 [95\% CI, -32.3 to -28.8]) in the intensive treatment group vs a decrease from 1134.0 to 1107.1 cm3 (difference, -26.9 cm3 [95\% CI, 24.8 to 28.8]) in the standard treatment group (between-group difference in change, -3.7 cm3 [95\% CI, -6.3 to -1.1]). Conclusions and Relevance: Among hypertensive adults, targeting an SBP of less than 120 mm Hg, compared with less than 140 mm Hg, was significantly associated with a smaller increase in cerebral white matter lesion volume and a greater decrease in total brain volume, although the differences were small.

  abstract = {Societies around the world are concerned about dementia and the other forms of cognitive impairment that affect many older adults. We now know that brain changes typically begin years before people show symptoms, which suggests a window of opportunity to prevent or delay the onset of these conditions. Emerging evidence that the prevalence of dementia is declining in high-income countries offers hope that public health interventions will be effective in preventing or delaying cognitive impairments. Until recently, the research and clinical communities have focused primarily on understanding and treating these conditions after they have developed. Thus, the evidence base on how to prevent or delay these conditions has been limited at best, despite the many claims of success made in popular media and advertising. Today, however, a growing body of prevention research is emerging. Preventing Cognitive Decline and Dementia: A Way Forward assesses the current state of knowledge on interventions to prevent cognitive decline and dementia, and informs future research in this area. This report provides recommendations of appropriate content for inclusion in public health messages from the National Institute on Aging.},

  abstract = {Background: Myalgic Encephalomyelitis/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) is a multisystem medical condition with heterogeneous symptom expression. Currently, there is no effective cure or treatment for the standard care of patients. A variety of ME/CFS symptoms can be linked to the vital life functions of the brainstem, the lower extension of the brain best known as the hub relaying information back and forth between the cerebral cortex and various parts of the body.Objective/Methods: Over the past decade, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) studies have emerged to understand ME/CFS with interesting findings, but there has lacked a synthesized evaluation of what has been found thus far regarding the involvement of the brainstem. We conducted this study to review and evaluate the recent MRI findings via a literature search of the MEDLINE database, from which 11 studies met the eligibility criteria.Findings: Data showed that MRI studies frequently reported structural changes in the white and gray matter. Abnormalities of the functional connectivity within the brainstem and with other brain regions have also been found. The studies have suggested possible mechanisms including astrocyte dysfunction, cerebral perfusion impairment, impaired nerve conduction, and neuroinflammation involving the brainstem, which may at least partially explain a substantial portion of the ME/CFS symptoms and their heterogeneous presentations in individual patients.Conclusions: This review draws research attention to the role of the brainstem in ME/CFS, helping enlighten future work to uncover the pathologies and mechanisms of this complex medical condition, for improved management and patient care.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Brain reserve can be defined as the individual variation in the brain structural characteristics that later in life are likely to modulate cognitive performance. Late midlife represents a point in aging where some structural brain imaging changes have become manifest but the effects of cognitive aging are minimal, and thus may represent an ideal opportunity to determine the relationship between risk factors and brain imaging biomarkers of reserve. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to assess neuroimaging measures from multiple modalities to broaden our understanding of brain reserve, and the late midlife risk factors that may make the brain vulnerable to age related cognitive disorders. METHODS: We examined multimodal [structural and diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), FDG PET] neuroimaging measures in 50-65 year olds to examine the associations between risk factors (Intellectual/Physical Activity: education-occupation composite, physical, and cognitive-based activity engagement; General Health Factors: presence of cardiovascular and metabolic conditions (CMC), body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, smoking status (ever/never), CAGE Alcohol Questionnaire ({$>$}2, yes/no), Beck Depression Inventory score), brain reserve measures [Dynamic: genu corpus callosum fractional anisotropy (FA), posterior cingulate cortex FDG uptake, superior parietal cortex thickness, AD signature cortical thickness; Static: intracranial volume], and cognition (global, memory, attention, language, visuospatial) from a population-based sample. We quantified dynamic proxies of brain reserve (cortical thickness, glucose metabolism, microstructural integrity) and investigated various protective/risk factors. RESULTS: Education-occupation was associated with cognition and total intracranial volume (static measure of brain reserve), but was not associated with any of the dynamic neuroimaging biomarkers. In contrast, many general health factors were associated with the dynamic neuroimaging proxies of brain reserve, while most were not associated with cognition in this late middle aged group. CONCLUSION: Brain reserve, as exemplified by the four dynamic neuroimaging features studied here, is itself at least partly influenced by general health status in midlife, but may be largely independent of education and occupation.},

Because most of the vascular resistance within the brain is in capillaries, this could reflect dysfunction of contractile pericytes on capillary walls. We used live and rapidly fixed biopsied human tissue to establish disease relevance, and rodent experiments to define mechanism. We found that in humans with cognitive decline, amyloid {$\beta$} (A{$\beta$}) constricts brain capillaries at pericyte locations. This was caused by A{$\beta$} generating reactive oxygen species, which evoked the release of endothelin-1 (ET) that activated pericyte ETA receptors. Capillary, but not arteriole, constriction also occurred in vivo in a mouse model of AD. Thus, inhibiting the capillary constriction caused by A{$\beta$} could potentially reduce energy lack and neurodegeneration in AD.},

How to define successful aging remains debated, but well-preserved age-sensitive cognitive functions, like episodic memory, is an often-suggested criterion. Evidence for successful memory aging comes from cross-sectional and longitudinal studies showing that some older individuals display high and stable levels of performance. Successful memory aging may be accomplished via multiple paths. One path is through brain maintenance, or relative lack of age-related brain pathology. Through another path, successful memory aging can be accomplished despite brain pathology by means of efficient compensatory and strategic processes. Genetic, epigenetic, and lifestyle factors influence memory aging via both paths. Some of these factors can be promoted throughout the life course, which, at the individual as well as the societal level, can positively impact successful memory aging.}

  abstract = {Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the fat mass and obesity associated (FTO) gene are linked to obesity, but how these SNPs influence resting-state neural activation is unknown. Few brain-imaging studies have investigated the influence of obesity-related SNPs on neural activity, and no study has investigated resting-state connectivity patterns. We tested connectivity within three, main resting-state networks: default mode (DMN), sensorimotor (SMN), and salience network (SN) in 30 male participants, grouped based on genotype for the rs9939609 FTO SNP, as well as punishment and reward sensitivity measured by the Behavioral Inhibition (BIS) and Behavioral Activation System (BAS) questionnaires. Because obesity is associated with anomalies in both systems, we calculated a BIS/BAS ratio (BBr) accounting for features of both scores. A prominence of BIS over BAS (higher BBr) resulted in increased connectivity in frontal and paralimbic regions. These alterations were more evident in the obesity-associated AA genotype, where a high BBr was also associated with increased SN connectivity in dopaminergic circuitries, and in a subnetwork involved in somatosensory integration regarding food. Participants with AA genotype and high BBr, compared to corresponding participants in the TT genotype, also showed greater DMN connectivity in regions involved in the processing of food cues, and in the SMN for regions involved in visceral perception and reward-based learning. These findings suggest that neural connectivity patterns influence the sensitivity toward punishment and reward more closely in the AA carriers, predisposing them to developing obesity. Our work explains a complex interaction between genetics, neural patterns, and behavioral measures in determining the risk for obesity and may help develop individually-tailored strategies for obesity prevention.}

  abstract = {Aging is related to cognitive decline, and it has been reported that aging disrupts some resting state brain networks. However, most studies have focused on the default mode network and ignored other resting state networks. In this study, we measured resting state activity using fMRI and explored whether cognitive decline with aging is related to disrupted resting state networks. Independent component analysis was used to evaluate functional connectivity. Notably, the connectivity within the salience network that consisted of the bilateral insula and the anterior cingulated cortex decreased with aging; the impairment of functional connectivity was correlated with measured decreases in individual cognitive abilities. Furthermore, certain internetwork connectivities (salience to auditory, default mode to visual, etc.) also decreased with aging. These results suggest that (1) aging affects not only the default mode network but also other networks, specifically the salience network; (2) aging affects internetwork connectivity; and (3) disruption of the salience network is related to cognitive decline in elderly people.},

Here we investigated the relationship between polygenic risk for obesity, gray matter structure and body mass index (BMI) by the use of univariate and multivariate analyses in two large, independent cohorts (n=330 and n=347). Higher BMI and higher polygenic risk for obesity were significantly associated with medial prefrontal gray matter decrease, and prefrontal gray matter was further shown to significantly mediate the effect of polygenic risk for obesity on BMI in both samples. Building on this, the successful individualized prediction of BMI by means of multivariate pattern classification algorithms trained on whole-brain imaging data and external validations in the second cohort points to potential clinical applications of this imaging trait marker.},

Regional deep (DWMH) and periventricular (PWMH) WMH loads were determined using an automated algorithm. We stratified on A?1-42 pathology (A?+/?) and analyzed group differences, as well as associations with Framingham Risk Score for cardiovascular disease (FRS-CVD) and age. Occipital PWMH (p?=?0.001) and occipital DWMH (p?=?0.003) loads were increased in SCD-A?+ compared with A?? controls. In MCI-A?+ compared with A?? controls, there were differences in global WMH (p?=?0.003), as well as occipital DWMH (p?=?0.001) and temporal DWMH (p?=?0.002) loads. FRS-CVD was associated with frontal PWMHs (p?=?0.003) and frontal DWMHs (p?=?0.005), after adjusting for age. There were associations between global and all regional WMH loads and age. In summary, posterior WMH loads were increased in SCD-A?+ and MCI-A?+ cases, whereas frontal WMHs were associated with vascular risk. The differences in WMH topography support the use of regional WMH load as an early-stage marker of etiology.}

  abstract = {Summary The term cerebral small vessel disease refers to a group of pathological processes with various aetiologies that affect the small arteries, arterioles, venules, and capillaries of the brain. Age-related and hypertension-related small vessel diseases and cerebral amyloid angiopathy are the most common forms. The consequences of small vessel disease on the brain parenchyma are mainly lesions located in the subcortical structures such as lacunar infarcts, white matter lesions, large haemorrhages, and microbleeds. Because lacunar infarcts and white matter lesions are easily detected by neuroimaging, whereas small vessels are not, the term small vessel disease is frequently used to describe the parenchyma lesions rather than the underlying small vessel alterations. This classification, however, restricts the definition of small vessel disease to ischaemic lesions and might be misleading. Small vessel disease has an important role in cerebrovascular disease and is a leading cause of cognitive decline and functional loss in the elderly. Small vessel disease should be a main target for preventive and treatment strategies, but all types of presentation and complications should be taken into account.}

  abstract = {Patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) frequently show decline in cognitive performance. However, neuroimaging in SVD patients discloses a wide range of brain lesions and alterations so that it is often difficult to understand which of these changes are the most relevant for cognitive decline. It has also become evident that visually-rated alterations do not fully explain the neuroimaging correlates of cognitive decline in SVD. Fractal dimension (FD), a unitless feature of structural complexity that can be computed from high-resolution T1-weighted images, has been recently applied to the neuroimaging evaluation of the human brain. Indeed, white matter (WM) and cortical gray matter (GM) exhibit an inherent structural complexity that can be measured through the FD. In our study, we included 64 patients (mean age+/-standard deviation, 74.6+/-6.9, education 7.9+/-4.2years, 53\% males) with SVD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and a control group of 24 healthy subjects (mean age+/-standard deviation, 72.3+/-4.4years, 50\% males). With the aim of assessing whether the FD values of cerebral WM (WM FD) and cortical GM (GM FD) could be valuable structural predictors of cognitive performance in patients with SVD and MCI, we employed a machine learning strategy based on LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression applied on a set of standard and advanced neuroimaging features in a nested cross-validation (CV) loop. This approach was aimed at 1) choosing the best predictive models, able to reliably predict the individual neuropsychological scores sensitive to attention and executive dysfunctions (prominent features of subcortical vascular cognitive impairment) and 2) identifying a features ranking according to their importance in the model through the assessment of the out-of-sample error. For each neuropsychological test, using 1000 repetitions of LASSO regression and 5000 random permutations, we found that the statistically significant models were those for the Montreal Cognitive Assessment scores (p-value=.039), Symbol Digit Modalities Test scores (p-value=.039), and Trail Making Test Part A scores (p-value=.025). Significant prediction of these scores was obtained using different sets of neuroimaging features in which the WM FD was the most frequently selected feature. In conclusion, we showed that a machine learning approach could be useful in SVD research field using standard and advanced neuroimaging features. Our study results raise the possibility that FD may represent a consistent feature in predicting cognitive decline in SVD that can complement standard imaging.},

  abstract = {The pathogenesis of age-related cerebral white matter changes (WMC) is still a matter of investigation. Alterations of deep small vessels, such as arteriolosclerosis, are considered to play a central role in the development of WMC. Stenosis or occlusion of small vessels may cause sudden or more chronic ischemia resulting in small areas of necrosis (lacunar infarction) or diffuse alterations consistent with the definition of white matter incomplete infarct. Moreover, the arteriolosclerotic changes may cause loss of autoregulation in the deep white matter and consequent cerebral blood flow fluctuations in response to changes of systemic blood pressure. Both these types of mechanisms may be particularly harmful because the blood supply of the white matter is of the terminal type with scarce anastomoses. Other pathophysiological hypotheses on the origin of WMC have been raised, and they can probably be considered as complementary to the ischemic one. The small vessel alterations could lead to damage of the blood-brain barrier and chronic leakage of fluid and macromolecules in the white matter. The increased interstitial fluid concentration in abnormal white matter may be also a consequence of arterial hypertensive bouts. Genetically determined factors could play an important role in the development of WMC, and at least one disease (cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy {\textendash} CADASIL) characterized by severe leukoencephalopathy exists with a determined genetic origin. It is possible that other genetic factors contribute, by interaction with conventional risk factors, to the development of white matter injury in nonfamilial cases.}

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are clinically significant MRI abnormalities often detected in the elderly and early stages of Alzheimer's Disease. They are indicative of vascular pathology but represent a mixture of microstructural tissue alterations that is highly variable between individuals. To better understand these alterations, we leveraged the signal of different MRI contrasts sampled within WMHs, which have differential sensitivity to microstructural properties. Subsequently, we sought to examine the asso of these WMH signal measures to clinically-relevant measures such as cortical and global brain atrophy, cognitive function, diagnostic and demographic differences, and Alzheimer's Disease-relevant cardiovascular risk factors. Our sample of 118 subjects was composed of healthy controls (n=30), high-risk of Alzheimer's Disease due to familial history (n=47), mild cognitive impairment (n=32), and clinical Alzheimer's Disease (n=9) as a means of ascertaining a spectrum of impairment. We sampled the median signal within WMHs on weighted MRI images that are commonly acquired (T1-weighted [T1w], T2-weighted [T2w], T1w/T2w ratio, Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery [FLAIR]), and the relaxation times from quantitative T1 (qT1) and T2* (qT2*) images. Main analyses were performed with a periventricular/deep/superficial white matter parcellation and were repeated with a lobar white matter parcellation. We demonstrated that the correlations between WMH signal measures were variable, suggesting that they are likely influenced by different microstructural properties. We observed that the WMH qT2* and FLAIR measures displayed different age- and disease-related trends compared to normal-appearing white matter, highlighting sensitivity to WMH-specific tissue deterioration. Further, WMH qT2* particularly in periventricular and occipital white matter regions was consistently associated with several of our clinical variables of interest using both parcellation schemes in univariate analyses, and further showed high contributions to a pattern of brain variables that was associated with age and cognitive variables in multivariate Partial Least Squares Correlation analyses. qT1 and FLAIR measures showed consistent clinical relationships in multivariate analyses only, while T1w, T2w, and T1w/T2w ratio measures were not consistently associated with clinical variables. We observed that the qT2* signal was sensitive to clinically-relevant microstructural tissue alterations specific to WMHs. Combining volumetric and signal measures of WMH, particularly qT2* and to a lesser extent qT1 and FLAIR, should be considered to more precisely characterize the severity of WMHs in vivo. These findings may have implications in determining the reversibility of WMHs and potential efficacy of cardio- and cerebrovascular treatments.},

  abstract = {Common obesity risk variants have been associated with macronutrient intake; however, these associations' generalizability across populations has not been demonstrated. We investigated the associations between 6 obesity risk variants in (or near) the NEGR1, TMEM18, BDNF, FTO, MC4R, and KCTD15 genes and macronutrient intake (carbohydrate, protein, ethanol, and fat) in 3 Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) studies: the Multiethnic Cohort Study (1993{\textendash}2006) (n = 19,529), the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study (1987{\textendash}1989) (n = 11,114), and the Epidemiologic Architecture for Genes Linked to Environment (EAGLE) Study, which accesses data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1991{\textendash}1994) (n = 6,347). We used linear regression, with adjustment for age, sex, and ethnicity, to estimate the associations between obesity risk genotypes and macronutrient intake. A fixed-effects meta-analysis model showed that the FTO rs8050136 A allele (n = 36,973) was positively associated with percentage of calories derived from fat ({$\beta$}meta = 0.2244 (standard error, 0.0548); P = 4 {\texttimes} 10-5) and inversely associated with percentage of calories derived from carbohydrate ({$\beta$}meta = -0.2796 (standard error, 0.0709); P = 8 {\texttimes} 10-5). In the Multiethnic Cohort Study, percentage of calories from fat assessed at baseline was a partial mediator of the rs8050136 effect on body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2) obtained at 10 years of follow-up (mediation of effect = 0.0823 kg/m2, 95\% confidence interval: 0.0559, 0.1128). Our data provide additional evidence that the association of FTO with obesity is partially mediated by dietary intake.}

  abstract = {Estimates of functional connectivity derived from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) are sensitive to artefacts caused by in-scanner head motion. This susceptibility has motivated the development of numerous denoising methods designed to mitigate motion-related artefacts. Here, we compare popular retrospective rs-fMRI denoising methods, such as regression of head motion parameters and mean white matter (WM) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) (with and without expansion terms), aCompCor, volume censoring (e.g., scrubbing and spike regression), global signal regression and ICA-AROMA, combined into 19 different pipelines. These pipelines were evaluated across five different quality control benchmarks in four independent datasets associated with varying levels of motion. Pipelines were benchmarked by examining the residual relationship between in-scanner movement and functional connectivity after denoising; the effect of distance on this residual relationship; whole-brain differences in functional connectivity between high- and low-motion healthy controls (HC); the temporal degrees of freedom lost during denoising; and the test-retest reliability of functional connectivity estimates. We also compared the sensitivity of each pipeline to clinical differences in functional connectivity in independent samples of people with schizophrenia and obsessive-compulsive disorder. Our results indicate that (1) simple linear regression of regional fMRI time series against head motion parameters and WM/CSF signals (with or without expansion terms) is not sufficient to remove head motion artefacts; (2) aCompCor pipelines may only be viable in low-motion data; (3) volume censoring performs well at minimising motion-related artefact but a major benefit of this approach derives from the exclusion of high-motion individuals; (4) while not as effective as volume censoring, ICA-AROMA performed well across our benchmarks for relatively low cost in terms of data loss; (5) the addition of global signal regression improved the performance of nearly all pipelines on most benchmarks, but exacerbated the distance-dependence of correlations between motion and functional connectivity; and (6) group comparisons in functional connectivity between healthy controls and schizophrenia patients are highly dependent on preprocessing strategy. We offer some recommendations for best practice and outline simple analyses to facilitate transparent reporting of the degree to which a given set of findings may be affected by motion-related artefact.},

  abstract = {Abdominal obesity is important for understanding obesity, which is a worldwide medical problem. We explored structural and functional brain differences in people with abdominal and non-abdominal obesity by using multimodal neuroimaging and up-to-date analysis methods. A total of 274 overweight people, whose body mass index exceeded 25, were enrolled in this study. Participants were divided into abdominal and non-abdominal obesity groups using a waist-hip ratio threshold of 0.9 for males and 0.85 for females. Structural and functional brain differences were assessed with diffusion tensor imaging and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Centrality measures were computed from structural fiber tractography, and static and dynamic functional connectivity matrices. Significant inter-group differences in structural and functional connectivity were found using degree centrality (DC) values. The associations between the DC values of the identified regions/networks and behaviors of eating disorder scores were explored. The highest association was achieved by combining DC values of the cerebral peduncle, anterior corona radiata, posterior corona radiata (from structural connectivity), frontoparietal network (from static connectivity), and executive control network (from dynamic connectivity) compared to the use of structural or functional connectivity only. Our results demonstrated the effectiveness of multimodal imaging data and found brain regions or networks that may be responsible for behaviors of eating disorders in people with abdominal obesity.}

MetS score was calculated for each subject. Middle cerebral artery hemodynamics was measured using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Indices of aortic, systemic, and carotid artery stiffness were derived.Subjects had subclinical MetS pathology (MetS score = 19.8 {$\pm$} 10.4) that was inversely associated with cerebrovascular conductance (CVC: r = -0.261, P = 0.02). Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) (r = -0.188, P = 0.09), brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity (baPWV) (r = -0.161, P = 0.15), and carotid artery distensibility (r = -0.10, P = 0.37) abrogated the direct association of MetS score and CVC, demonstrating full mediation. Nonparametric bootstrapping further indicated significant indirect effects of cfPWV, baPWV, and carotid artery distensibility, fully mediating reductions of CVC exerted from sublcinical MetS. Carotid artery distensibility demonstrated the greatest effect on CVC (B = -0.0019, SE = 0.0012, -0.0050 to -0.0002 95\% confidence interval).Arterial stiffness, particularly the stiffness of the carotid artery, mediated reductions in CVC related to MetS.}

Linear regressions related each SVD marker to neuropsychological performances and adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, education, cognitive diagnosis, APOE {$\epsilon$}4 presence, Framingham Stroke Risk Profile, and intracranial volume.Results WMH related to the most neuropsychological measures, including the Boston Naming Test, Animal Naming, Coding, Number Sequencing, Executive Function Composite, and Hooper Visual Organization Test performances (p {$\leq$} 0.01). PVS related to multiple information processing and executive function performances (p {$\leq$} 0.02). Lacunes and CMBs related to fewer measures than expected. Combined models simultaneously testing multiple statistically significant SVD predictors suggested that WMH, PVS, and CMBs each independently related to information processing and executive function performances; however, compared to other SVD markers, PVS remained statistically significant in models related to information processing and executive functioning performances.Conclusions As expected, increased WMH corresponded to poorer performances across multiple cognitive domains. PVS, previously considered a benign neuroimaging feature in older adults, may have important clinical implications because PVS was related to information processing and executive function performances even in combined models.

  abstract = {Understanding the neuropathological underpinnings of mental disorders such as schizophrenia, major depression, and bipolar disorder is an essential step towards the development of targeted treatments. Diffusion MRI studies utilizing the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) model have been extremely successful to date in identifying microstructural brain abnormalities in individuals suffering from mental illness, especially in regions of white matter, although identified abnormalities have been biologically non-specific. Building on DTI's success, in recent years more advanced diffusion MRI methods have been developed and applied to the study of psychiatric populations, with the aim of offering increased sensitivity to subtle neurological abnormalities, as well as improved specificity to candidate pathologies such as demyelination and neuroinflammation. These advanced methods, however, usually come at the cost of prolonged imaging sequences or reduced signal to noise, and they are more difficult to evaluate compared with the more simplified approach taken by the now common DTI model. To date, a limited number of advanced diffusion MRI methods have been employed to study schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder populations. In this review we survey these studies, compare findings across diverse methods, discuss the main benefits and limitations of the different methods, and assess the extent to which the application of more advanced diffusion imaging approaches has led to novel and transformative information with regards to our ability to better understand the etiology and pathology of mental disorders.},

Methods We systematically reviewed the literature, 2006 to late 2016, for machine learning studies differentiating healthy aging from dementia of various types, assessing study quality, and comparing accuracy at different disease boundaries. Results Of 111 relevant studies, most assessed Alzheimer's disease versus healthy controls, using AD Neuroimaging Initiative data, support vector machines, and only T1-weighted sequences. Accuracy was highest for differentiating Alzheimer's disease from healthy controls and poor for differentiating healthy controls versus mild cognitive impairment versus Alzheimer's disease or mild cognitive impairment converters versus nonconverters. Accuracy increased using combined data types, but not by data source, sample size, or machine learning method. Discussion Machine learning does not differentiate clinically relevant disease categories yet. More diverse data sets, combinations of different types of data, and close clinical integration of machine learning would help to advance the field.},

  abstract = {Objectives This study was designed to explore the appropriate blood pressure (BP) target required to reduce cognitive decline and brain white matter lesions (WMLs) in elderly hypertensive patients. Methods Elderly patients (n~=~294, {$\geq$}80~years of age) being treated for hypertension were enrolled in a longitudinal study examining cognitive impairment after an initial assessment and a period of 4~years. All patients underwent neurological and cognitive assessment, laboratory examination, and magnetic resonance imaging of the brain. Results The 4-year follow-up examination revealed that body mass index, alcohol consumption, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure, and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) all showed a significant decline, whereas fasting plasma glucose, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume, and the WMH/total intracranial volume (TIV) ratio were significantly increased when compared with baseline observations. Interestingly, the decline in MMSE, as well as the increment of WMH and WMH/TIV ratio was smaller in patients with SBP ranging from 140 to 160~mm Hg than in those whose SBP was lower than 140~mm Hg or higher than 160~mm Hg (P~{$<~$}.05). Furthermore, we observed that a 15 to 35~mm Hg targeted lowering of SBP in the elderly patients was more beneficial to our cognitive analysis than treatments that achieved less than 15~mm Hg or greater than 35~mm Hg (P~{$<~$}.05). Conclusions In elderly hypertensive patients, there exists a beneficial target for SBP lowering beyond which treatment may not be beneficial for improving or delaying the progression of cognitive impairment and WMLs.},

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel diseases of the brain are a major determinant of cognitive impairment in the elderly. In small vessel diseases, the most easily identifiable lesions, both at post-mortem evaluation and magnetic resonance imaging, lie in subcortical areas. However, recent results obtained post-mortem, particularly in severe cases, have highlighted the burden of cortex lesions such as microinfarcts and diffuse neuronal loss. The recent development of image post-processing methods allows now assessing in~vivo multiple aspects of the cerebral cortex. This systematic review aimed to analyze in~vivo magnetic resonance imaging studies evaluating cortex alterations at different stages of small vessel diseases. Studies assessing the relationships between small vessel disease magnetic resonance imaging markers obtained at the subcortical level and cortex estimates were reviewed both in community-dwelling elderly and in patients with symptomatic small vessel diseases. Thereafter, studies analyzing cortex estimates in small vessel disease patients compared with healthy subjects were evaluated. The results support that important cortex alterations develop along the course of small vessel diseases independently of concomitant neurodegenerative processes. Easy detection and quantification of cortex changes in small vessel diseases as well as understanding their underlying mechanisms are challenging tasks for better understanding cognitive decline in small vessel diseases.}

T1-weighted 1\,mm3 isotropic resolution MR images were acquired for thirty healthy subjects (15 females). Caudate nucleus and putamen were segmented manually by two independent observers and automatically by FIRST and Freesurfer (v4.5 and v5.3). Utilizing manual labels as reference standard the following measures were studied: Dice coefficient (D), percentage volume difference (PVD), absolute volume difference as well as intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for consistency and absolute agreement. For putamen segmentation, FIRST achieved higher D, lower PVD and higher ICC for absolute agreement with manual tracing than either version of Freesurfer. Freesurfer overestimated the putamen, while FIRST was not statistically different from manual tracing. The ICC for consistency with manual tracing was similar between the two methods. For caudate segmentation, FIRST and Freesurfer performed more similarly. In conclusion, Freesurfer and FIRST are not equivalent when comparing to manual tracing. FIRST was superior for putaminal segmentation.}

  abstract = {As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections have been shown to affect the central nervous system, the investigation of associated alterations of brain structure and neuropsychological sequelae is crucial to help address future health care needs. Therefore, we performed a comprehensive neuroimaging and neuropsychological assessment of 223 nonvaccinated individuals recovered from a mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection (100 female/123 male, age [years], mean {$\pm$} SD, 55.54 {$\pm$} 7.07; median 9.7~mo after infection) in comparison with 223 matched controls (93 female/130 male, 55.74 {$\pm$} 6.60) within the framework of the Hamburg City Health Study. Primary study outcomes were advanced diffusion MRI measures of white matter microstructure, cortical thickness, white matter hyperintensity load, and neuropsychological test scores. Among all 11 MRI markers tested, significant differences were found in global measures of mean diffusivity (MD) and extracellular free water which were elevated in the white matter of post-SARS-CoV-2 individuals compared to matched controls (free water: 0.148 {$\pm$} 0.018 vs. 0.142 {$\pm$} 0.017, P~{$<$} 0.001; MD [10-3~mm2/s]: 0.747 {$\pm$} 0.021 vs. 0.740 {$\pm$} 0.020, P~{$<$} 0.001). Group classification accuracy based on diffusion imaging markers was up to 80\%. Neuropsychological test scores did not significantly differ between groups. Collectively, our findings suggest that subtle changes in white matter extracellular water content last beyond the acute infection with SARS-CoV-2. However, in our sample, a mild to moderate SARS-CoV-2 infection was not associated with neuropsychological deficits, significant changes in cortical structure, or vascular lesions several months after recovery. External validation of our findings and longitudinal follow-up investigations are needed.},

We used an unbiased pattern discovery approach to identify distinct WMH spatial patterns and investigate their association with different WMH etiologies.Methods We performed a cross-sectional study on participants of the Alzheimer\&\#039;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) to identify spatially distinct WMH distribution patterns using voxel-based spectral clustering analysis of aligned WMH probability maps. We included all participants from the ADNI Grand Opportunity/ADNI 2 study with available baseline 2D-FLAIR MRI scans, without history of stroke or presence of infarction on imaging. We evaluated the associations of these WMH spatial patterns with vascular risk factors, amyloid-{$\beta$} PET, and imaging biomarkers of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), characterizing different forms of cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) using multivariable regression. We also used linear regression models to investigate whether WMH spatial distribution influenced cognitive impairment.Results We analyzed MRI scans of 1,046 ADNI participants with mixed vascular and amyloid-related risk factors (mean age 72.9, 47.7\% female, 31.4\% hypertensive, 48.3\% with abnormal amyloid PET). We observed unbiased partitioning of WMH into 5 unique spatial patterns: deep frontal, periventricular, juxtacortical, parietal, and posterior. Juxtacortical WMH were independently associated with probable CAA, deep frontal WMH were associated with risk factors for arteriolosclerosis (hypertension and diabetes), and parietal WMH were associated with brain amyloid accumulation, consistent with an Alzheimer disease (AD) phenotype. Juxtacortical, deep frontal, and parietal WMH spatial patterns were associated with cognitive impairment. Periventricular and posterior WMH spatial patterns were unrelated to any disease phenotype or cognitive decline.Discussion Data-driven WMH spatial patterns reflect discrete underlying etiologies including arteriolosclerosis, CAA, AD, and normal aging. Global measures of WMH volume may miss important spatial distinctions. WMH spatial signatures may serve as etiology-specific imaging markers, helping to resolve WMH heterogeneity, identify the dominant underlying pathologic process, and improve prediction of clinical-relevant trajectories that influence cognitive decline.AD=Alzheimer disease; ADNI=Alzheimer\&\#039;s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative; CAA=cerebral amyloid angiopathy; CDR=Clinical Dementia Rating; CSVD=cerebral small vessel disease; cSS=cortical superficial siderosis; HTN=hypertension; HTN-S=hypertension score; ICH=intracerebral hemorrhage; IQR=interquartile range; SBP=systolic blood pressure; SL-CMB=strictly lobar cerebral microbleeds; SUVR=standardized uptake value ratio; WMH=white matter hyperintensities}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD) is a progressive neurodegenerative brain disorder, clinically characterized by changes in cognition, personality, and behavior. Marked disturbances in eating behavior, such as overeating and preference for sweet foods, are also commonly reported. The hypothalamus plays a critical role in feeding regulation, yet the relation between pathology in this region and eating behavior in FTD is unknown. This study aimed to address this issue using 2 complementary approaches. METHODS: First, 18 early stage bvFTD patients and 16 healthy controls underwent high-resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging and assessment of eating behavior. Hypothalamic volumes were traced manually on coronal images. Second, postmortem analyses of 12 bvFTD cases and 6 matched controls were performed. Fixed hypothalamic tissue sections were stained for a cell marker and for peptides regulating feeding behaviors using immunohistochemistry. Stereological estimates of the hypothalamic volume and the number of neurons and glia were performed. RESULTS: Significant atrophy of the hypothalamus in bvFTD was present in both analyses. Patients with high feeding disturbance exhibited significant atrophy of the posterior hypothalamus. Neuronal loss, which was observed only in bvFTD cases with Tar DNA protein-43 deposition, was also predominant posteriorly. In contrast, orexin (hypocretin), neuropeptide Y, cocaine- and amphetamine-regulating transcript, and vasopressin-containing neurons that regulate appetite were spared in posterior nuclei known to participate in feeding regulation. INTERPRETATION: Degeneration and consequent dysregulation within the hypothalamus relates to significant feeding disturbance in bvFTD. These findings provide a basis for the development of therapeutic models. Ann Neurol 2011}

The increase in blood pressure with age is mostly associated with structural changes in the arteries and especially with large artery stiffness. It is known from various studies that rising blood pressure is associated with increased cardiovascular risk. In the elderly, the most powerful predictor of risk is increased pulse pressure due to decreased diastolic and increased systolic blood pressure. All evidence indicates that treating the elderly hypertensive patient will reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. However, there is no evidence yet for the very elderly. This population is particularly susceptible to side effects of treatments and the reduction of blood pressure, although reducing the risk of cardiovascular events such as stroke, may result in increased mortality.},

Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation. The article continues with a discussion of how magnetic field gradients are used to facilitate spatial encoding and concludes with a development of basic pulse sequences and the factors defining image contrast.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite several known risk factors it is still difficult to foresee who will develop a stroke and who will not. Vascular brain damage, visualised with MRI, reflects how the brain tolerates the effects of vascular risk factors and may therefore be relevant in predicting individual stroke risk. OBJECTIVE: To examine whether the presence of small vessel disease on brain MRI could improve the prediction of stroke beyond the classic stroke risk factors from the 1991 Framingham Stroke Risk Function. METHODS: 1007 community-dwelling elderly people, free of stroke at baseline were included in the study. Small vessel disease--that is, the presence of silent brain infarcts (SBI) and white matter lesions (WML), was scored on MRI scans obtained in 1995-6. 10-Year stroke risk prediction was assessed by the C statistic and by reclassification adding SBI and WML to a risk model including the classic stroke risk factors. RESULTS: During 10-years of follow-up 99 strokes occurred. Individual stroke risk prediction significantly improved from 0.73 (95\% CI 0.67 to 0.78) to 0.75 (0.69 to 0.80) in men and from 0.69 (0.64 to 0.75) to 0.77 (0.71 to 0.82) in women after inclusion of SBI and periventricular WML to the stroke risk factors. Reclassification occurred mainly in the intermediate stroke risk group (men 26\%; women 61\% reclassified). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of small vessel disease with MRI beyond the classic stroke risk factors improved the prediction of subsequent stroke, especially in women with an intermediate stroke risk. These findings support the use of MRI as a possible tool for better identifying people at high risk of stroke.},

  abstract = {Abstract Biomarkers for dementia of Alzheimer's type (DAT) are sought to facilitate accurate prediction of the disease onset, ideally predating the onset of cognitive deterioration. T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a commonly used neuroimaging modality for measuring brain structure in vivo, potentially providing information enabling the design of biomarkers for DAT. We propose a novel biomarker using structural MRI volume-based features to compute a similarity score for the individual's structural patterns relative to those observed in the DAT group. We employed ensemble-learning framework that combines structural features in most discriminative ROIs to create an aggregate measure of neurodegeneration in the brain. This classifier is trained on 423 stable normal control (NC) and 330 DAT subjects, where clinical diagnosis is likely to have the highest certainty. Independent validation on 8,834 unseen images from ADNI, AIBL, OASIS, and MIRIAD Alzheimer's disease (AD) databases showed promising potential to predict the development of DAT depending on the time-to-conversion (TTC). Classification performance on stable versus progressive mild cognitive impairment (MCI) groups achieved an AUC of 0.81 for TTC of 6?months and 0.73 for TTC of up to 7?years, achieving state-of-the-art results. The output score, indicating similarity to patterns seen in DAT, provides an intuitive measure of how closely the individual's brain features resemble the DAT group. This score can be used for assessing the presence of AD structural atrophy patterns in normal aging and MCI stages, as well as monitoring the progression of the individual's brain along with the disease course.},

These changes cause systematic but spurious correlation structures throughout the brain. Specifically, many long-distance correlations are decreased by subject motion, whereas many short-distance correlations are increased. These changes in rs-fcMRI correlations do not arise from, nor are they adequately countered by, some common functional connectivity processing steps. Two indices of data quality are proposed, and a simple method to reduce motion-related effects in rs-fcMRI analyses is demonstrated that should be flexibly implementable across a variety of software platforms. We demonstrate how application of this technique impacts our own data, modifying previous conclusions about brain development. These results suggest the need for greater care in dealing with subject motion, and the need to critically revisit previous rs-fcMRI work that may not have adequately controlled for effects of transient subject movements.},

We defined white matter hyperintensity (WMH) progression as an increase of {$\geq$}2 points on the 9-point Cardiovascular Health Study scale across scans.

We used adjusted logistic regression to evaluate the association between smoking variables and WMH progression in the total sample and separately by race (black and white). Results: We found WMH progression in 23\% of participants (30\% of black participants, 17\% of white participants). Overall, being a current smoker 6 years before baseline was associated with WMH progression. In race-stratified analyses, we found adverse associations with smoking status at multiple time points and persistent smoking in white but not in black participants. However, we found no statistical support for effect modification by race for most of these analyses. Increasing pack-years of smoking was associated with greater risk of WMH progression, while time since quitting and age at smoking initiation were not associated with WMH progression, with little indication of differences in these associations by race. Conclusions: Our findings concur with previous studies suggesting a relationship between smoking and WMH progression, and further demonstrate a dose-dependent association.},

  abstract = {Head motion estimates in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans appear qualitatively different with sub-second image sampling rates compared to the multi-second sampling rates common in the past. Whereas formerly the head appeared still for much of a scan with brief excursions from baseline, the head now appears to be in constant motion, and motion estimates often seem to divulge little information about what is happening in a scan. This constant motion has been attributed to respiratory oscillations that do not alias at faster sampling rates, and investigators are divided on the extent to which such motion is ``real'' motion or only ``apparent'' pseudomotion. Some investigators have abandoned the use of motion estimates entirely due to these considerations. Here we investigate the properties of motion in several fMRI datasets sampled at rates between 720 and 1160\,ms, and describe 5 distinct kinds of respiratory motion: 1) constant real respiratory motion in the form of head nodding most evident in vertical position and pitch, which can be very large; 2) constant pseudomotion at the same respiratory rate as real motion, occurring only in the phase encode direction; 3) punctate real motions occurring at times of very deep breaths; 4) a low-frequency pseudomotion in only the phase encode direction at and after very deep breaths; 5) slow modulation of vertical and anterior-posterior head position by the respiratory envelope. We reformulate motion estimates in light of these considerations and obtain good concordance between motion estimates, physiologic records, image quality measures, and events evident in the fMRI signals. We demonstrate how variables describing respiration or body habitus separately scale with distinct kinds of head motion. We also note heritable aspects of respiration and motion.}

New WMH and persistent NAWM voxels in relation to WMH penumbra at follow-up were identified. Mean baseline CBF and DTI variables of the new WMH and persistent NAWM voxels were computed. Univariate analyses with paired t tests were performed. Generalized estimating equation analyses were used to compare the relationships of baseline CBF, and structural penumbras with WMH growth, controlling for confounders.Results Low baseline CBF and fractional anisotropy, and high mean diffusivity (MD), were independently associated with new PVWMH voxels, with MD being the best predictor of WMH growth. A separate model demonstrated that radial diffusivity had the strongest relationship with WMH growth compared with CBF and axial diffusivity.Conclusion CBF and DTI measures independently predict WMH growth over time. DTI is a more sensitive predictor of WMH growth than CBF, with WMH progression likely due to demyelinating injury secondary to low perfusion. Findings support the use of MD as a sensitive marker of NAWM vulnerability in future trials aimed at preserving WM integrity.AD=axial diffusivity; ASL=arterial spin labeling; CBF=cerebral blood flow; DTI=diffusion tensor imaging; DWMH=deep white matter hyperintensity; FA=fractional anisotropy; FLAIR=fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; GEE=generalized estimating equation; MD=mean diffusivity; MPRAGE=magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo; NAWM=normal-appearing white matter; pASL=pulsed arterial spin labeling; PVWMH=periventricular white matter hyperintensity; RD=radial diffusivity; TE=echo time; TI=inversion time; TR=repetition time; WM=white matter; WMH=white matter hyperintensity}

  abstract = {Joint models initially dedicated to a single longitudinal marker and a single time-to-event need to be extended to account for the rich longitudinal data of cohort studies. Multiple causes of clinical progression are indeed usually observed, and multiple longitudinal markers are collected when the true latent trait of interest is hard to capture (e.g., quality of life, functional dependency, and cognitive level). These multivariate and longitudinal data also usually have nonstandard distributions (discrete, asymmetric, bounded, etc.). We propose a joint model based on a latent process and latent classes to analyze simultaneously such multiple longitudinal markers of different natures, and multiple causes of progression. A latent process model describes the latent trait of interest and links it to the observed longitudinal outcomes using flexible measurement models adapted to different types of data, and a latent class structure links the longitudinal and cause-specific survival models. The joint model is estimated in the maximum likelihood framework. A score test is developed to evaluate the assumption of conditional independence of the longitudinal markers and each cause of progression given the latent classes. In addition, individual dynamic cumulative incidences of each cause of progression based on the repeated marker data are derived. The methodology is validated in a simulation study and applied on real data about cognitive aging obtained from a large population-based study. The aim is to predict the risk of dementia by accounting for the competing death according to the profiles of semantic memory measured by two asymmetric psychometric tests.

  abstract = {As with many health constructs, cognition is difficult to measure accurately; it is assessed by multiple psychometric tests. Two approaches are commonly adopted to address this multivariate aspect in longitudinal analyses: the composite score approach summarizes the tests into a single outcome and subsequently analyzes its change; the multivariate approach relates the tests to the underlying cognitive level and simultaneously analyzes its change. We compared the quality of inference of these approaches in a simulation study based on three combinations of tests inspired by two population-based cohorts. In the absence of missing data and with relatively Gaussian psychometric tests, the composite score approach provided similar type-I error rates and statistical power as the multivariate latent process approach. In the more plausible scenario with departures from normality, transformations of each constituent test or of the composite score were required to avoid excess type-I error rates. When missing tests were more likely in cognitively impaired subjects, inference with the composite was not correct. In conclusion, composite scores can be used to assess risk factors for cognitive change provided they are correctly normalized, constituent tests are reliable and the amount of uninformative missing tests remains small. Otherwise, latent variable models are recommended.}

Methods Potentially eligible publications were those providing effect estimates of relative risk (RR) for the association between Mediterranean diet and the aforementioned outcomes. Studies were sought in PubMed up to October 31, 2012. Maximally adjusted effect estimates were extracted; separate analyses were performed for high and moderate adherence. Results Twenty-two eligible studies were included (11 covered stroke, 9 covered depression, and 8 covered cognitive impairment; only 1 pertained to Parkinson's disease). High adherence to Mediterranean diet was consistently associated with reduced risk for stroke (RR?=?0.71, 95\% confidence interval [CI]?=?0.57?0.89), depression (RR?=?0.68, 95\% CI?=?0.54?0.86), and cognitive impairment (RR?=?0.60, 95\% CI?=?0.43?0.83). Moderate adherence was similarly associated with reduced risk for depression and cognitive impairment, whereas the protective trend concerning stroke was only marginal. Subgroup analyses highlighted the protective actions of high adherence in terms of reduced risk for ischemic stroke, mild cognitive impairment, dementia, and particularly Alzheimer disease. Meta-regression analysis indicated that the protective effects of Mediterranean diet in stroke prevention seemed more sizeable among males. Concerning depression, the protective effects of high adherence seemed independent of age, whereas the favorable actions of moderate adherence seemed to fade away with more advanced age. Interpretation Adherence to a Mediterranean diet may contribute to the prevention of a series of brain diseases; this may be of special value given the aging of Western societies.

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Growing evidence implicates hypothalamic inflammation in the pathogenesis of diet-induced obesity and cognitive dysfunction in rodent models. Few studies have addressed the association between obesity and hypothalamic damage in humans and its relevance. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine markers of obesity-associated hypothalamic damage on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and to determine whether DTI metrics are associated with performance on cognitive testing. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: This cross-sectional study analyzed DTI metrics (primary [lambda(1)], secondary [lambda(2)], and tertiary [lambda(3)] eigenvalues; fractional anisotropy; and mean diffusivity) in the hypothalamus of 24 consecutive middle-age obese subjects (13 women; 49.8 +/- 8.1 y; body mass index [BMI], 43.9 +/- 0.92 kg/m(2)) and 20 healthy volunteers (10 women; 48.8 +/- 9.5 y; BMI, 24.3 +/- 0.79 kg/m(2)). OUTCOME: measures: Hypothalamic damage assessed by DTI metrics and cognitive performance evaluated by neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: lambda(1) values in the hypothalamus were significantly lower in obese subjects (P {$<$} .0001). The sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for obesity-associated hypothalamic damage by lambda(1) {$<$} 1.072 were 75, 87.5, 83.3, and 80.7\%, respectively. Patients with hypothalamic lambda(1) {$<$} 1.072 had higher values of BMI, fat mass, inflammatory markers, carotid-intima media thickness, and hepatic steatosis and lower scores on cognitive tests. Combined BMI and alanine aminotransferase had the strongest association with hypothalamic damage reflected by lambda(1) {$<$} 1.072 (area under the curve = 0.89). CONCLUSIONS: DTI detects obesity-associated hypothalamic damage associated with inflammatory markers and worse cognitive performance. This study highlights the potential utility of lambda(1) as a surrogate marker of obesity-associated hypothalamic damage. FAU - Puig, Josep},

Although some patients totally recover from COVID-19 pneumonia, the disease's long-term effects on the brain still need to be explored.METHODS We recruited 51 patients with 2 subtypes of COVID-19 (19 mild and 32 severe) with no specific neurological manifestations at the acute stage and no obvious lesions on the conventional MRI 3 months after discharge. Changes in gray matter morphometry, cerebral blood flow (CBF), and white matter (WM) microstructure were investigated using MRI. The relationship between brain imaging measurements and inflammation markers was further analyzed.RESULTS Compared with healthy controls, the decrease in cortical thickness/CBF and the changes in WM microstructure were more severe in patients with severe disease than in those with mild disease, especially in the frontal and limbic systems. Furthermore, changes in brain microstructure, CBF, and tract parameters were significantly correlated (P {$<$} 0.05) with the inflammatory markers C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and interleukin 6.CONCLUSION Indirect injury related to inflammatory storm may damage the brain, altering cerebral volume, CBF, and WM tracts. COVID-19{\textendash}related hypoxemia and dysfunction of vascular endothelium may also contribute to neurological changes. The abnormalities in these brain areas need to be monitored during recovery, which could help clinicians understand the potential neurological sequelae of COVID-19.FUNDING Natural Science Foundation of China.}

New measures are needed to improve the diagnosis of individuals with cognitive impairment due to various etiologies. Here, we report a deep learning framework that accomplishes multiple diagnostic steps in successive fashion to identify persons with normal cognition (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), AD, and non-AD dementias (nADD). We demonstrate a range of models capable of accepting flexible combinations of routinely collected clinical information, including demographics, medical history, neuropsychological testing, neuroimaging, and functional assessments. We then show that these frameworks compare favorably with the diagnostic accuracy of practicing neurologists and neuroradiologists. Lastly, we apply interpretability methods in computer vision to show that disease-specific patterns detected by our models track distinct patterns of degenerative changes throughout the brain and correspond closely with the presence of neuropathological lesions on autopsy. Our work demonstrates methodologies for validating computational predictions with established standards of medical diagnosis.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dementia and obesity are increasingly important public health issues. Obesity in middle age has been proposed to lead to dementia in old age. We investigated the association between BMI and risk of dementia. METHODS: For this retrospective cohort study, we used a cohort of 1,958,191 individuals derived from the United Kingdom Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) which included people aged 40 years or older in whom BMI was recorded between 1992 and 2007. Follow-up was until the practice's final data collection date, patient death or transfer out of practice, or first record of dementia (whichever occurred first). People with a previous record of dementia were excluded. We used Poisson regression to calculate incidence rates of dementia for each BMI category. FINDINGS: Our cohort of 1,958,191 people from UK general practices had a median age at baseline of 55 years (IQR 45-66) and a median follow-up of 9.1 years (IQR 6.3-12.6). Dementia occurred in 45,507 people, at a rate of 2.4 cases per 1000 person-years. Compared with people of a healthy weight, underweight people (BMI {$<$}20 kg/m(2)) had a 34\% higher (95\% CI 29-38) risk of dementia. Furthermore, the incidence of dementia continued to fall for every increasing BMI category, with very obese people (BMI {$>$}40 kg/m(2)) having a 29\% lower (95\% CI 22-36) dementia risk than people of a healthy weight. These patterns persisted throughout two decades of follow-up, after adjustment for potential confounders and allowance for the J-shape association of BMI with mortality. INTERPRETATION: Being underweight in middle age and old age carries an increased risk of dementia over two decades. Our results contradict the hypothesis that obesity in middle age could increase the risk of dementia in old age. The reasons for and public health consequences of these findings need further investigation. FUNDING: None.}

In the present study, we examined 2 main questions: 1) Do diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal change in cognition independently or synergistically with amyloid status? 2) Are the effects of diffusion characteristics on longitudinal cognitive change tract-specific or global in nature? Cognitive domains of executive function, episodic memory, and processing speed were measured annually (mean follow-up = 3.93 {$\pm$} 1.25 years). Diffusion tensor imaging and Pittsburgh Compound-B positron emission tomography were performed at baseline in 265 clinically normal older adults (aged 63{\textendash}90). Tract-specific diffusion was measured as the mean fractional anisotropy (FA) for 9 major white matter tracts. Global diffusion was measured as the mean FA across the 9 white matter tracts. Linear mixed models demonstrated independent, rather than synergistic, effects of global FA and amyloid status on cognitive decline. After controlling for amyloid status, lower global FA was associated with worse longitudinal performance in episodic memory and processing speed, but not executive function. After accounting for global FA, none of the individual tracts predicted a significant change in cognitive performance. These findings suggest that global, rather than tract-specific, diffusion characteristics predict longitudinal cognitive decline independently of amyloid status.}

Vascular risk and {$\beta$}-amyloid (A{$\beta$}) pathology commonly co-occur in older adults and are significant causes of cognitive impairment.To determine whether vascular risk and A{$\beta$} burden act additively or synergistically to promote cognitive decline in clinically normal older adults; and, secondarily, to evaluate the unique influence of vascular risk on prospective cognitive decline beyond that of commonly used imaging biomarkers, including A{$\beta$} burden, hippocampal volume, fludeoxyglucose F18{\textendash}labeled (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET), and white matter hyperintensities, a marker of cerebrovascular disease.In this longitudinal observational study, we examined clinically normal older adults from the Harvard Aging Brain Study. Participants were required to have baseline imaging data (FDG-PET, A{$\beta$}-PET, and magnetic resonance imaging), baseline medical data to quantify vascular risk, and at least 1 follow-up neuropsychological visit. Data collection began in 2010 and is ongoing. Data analysis was performed on data collected between 2010 and 2017.Vascular risk was quantified using the Framingham Heart Study general cardiovascular disease (FHS-CVD) risk score. We measured A{$\beta$} burden with Pittsburgh Compound-B PET. Cognition was measured annually with the Preclinical Alzheimer Cognitive Composite. Models were corrected for baseline age, sex, years of education, and apolipoprotein E {$\epsilon$}4 status.Of the 223 participants, 130 (58.3\%) were women. The mean (SD) age was 73.7 (6.0) years, and the mean (SD) follow-up time was 3.7 (1.2) years. Faster cognitive decline was associated with both a higher FHS-CVD risk score ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.064; 95\% CI, -0.094 to -0.033; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and higher A{$\beta$} burden ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.058; 95\% CI, -0.079 to -0.037; P\,\&lt;\,.001). The interaction of the FHS-CVD risk score and A{$\beta$} burden with time was significant ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.040, 95\% CI, -0.062 to -0.018; P\,\&lt;\,.001), suggesting a synergistic effect. The FHS-CVD risk score remained robustly associated with prospective cognitive decline ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.055; 95\% CI, -0.086 to -0.024; P\,\&lt;\,.001), even after adjustment for A{$\beta$} burden, hippocampal volume, FDG-PET uptake, and white matter hyperintensities.In this study, vascular risk was associated with prospective cognitive decline in clinically normal older adults, both alone and synergistically with A{$\beta$} burden. Vascular risk may complement imaging biomarkers in assessing risk of prospective cognitive decline in preclinical Alzheimer disease.}

The prescribed Mediterranean diets varied considerably between studies, particularly with regards to quantitative food advice. Only 8/66 (12.1\%) of individual cognitive outcomes at trial level significantly favored a Mediterranean diet for cognitive performance, with effect sizes (ESs) ranging from small (0.32) to large (1.66), whereas 2 outcomes favored controls. Data limitations precluded a meta-analysis. Of 8 domain composite cognitive scores from 2 studies, the 3 (Memory, Frontal, and Global function) from PREDIMED (PREvenci{\'o}n con DIeta MEDiterr{\'a}nea) were significant, with ESs ranging from 0.39 to 1.29. A posttest comparison at a second PREDIMED site found that the Mediterranean diet modulates the effect of several genotypes associated with dementia risk for some cognitive outcomes, with mixed results. Finally, the risk of low-plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor was reduced by 78\% (OR~=~0.22; 95\% CI: 0.05, 0.90) in those who consumed a Mediterranean diet compared to control diet at 3 y in this trial. There was no benefit of the Mediterranean diet for incident cognitive impairment or dementia.Five RCTs of the Mediterranean diet and cognition have been published to date. The data are mostly nonsignificant, with small ESs. However, the significant improvements in cognitive domain composites in the most robustly designed study warrant additional research.}

  abstract = {Cerebral white matter lesions (WMLs) reflect small vessel disease, are common in elderly individuals, and are associated with cognitive impairment. We sought to determine the relationships between WMLs, age, gray matter (GM) volume, and cognition in the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS). From the Cardiovascular Health Study we selected 740 cognitively normal controls with a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain and a detailed diagnostic evaluation. WML severity was determined using a standardized visual rating system. GM volumes were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry implemented in the Statistical Parametric Mapping software. WMLs were inversely correlated with GM volume, with the greatest volume loss in the frontal cortex. Age-related atrophy was observed in the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex. Regression analyses revealed links among age, APOE*4 allele, hypertension, WMLs, GM volume, and digit symbol substitution test scores. Both advancing age and hypertension predict higher WML load, which is itself associated with GM atrophy. Longitudinal data are needed to confirm the temporal sequence of events leading to a decline in cognitive function.},

  abstract = {Background The medium-term effects of Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) on organ health, exercise capacity, cognition, quality of life and mental health are poorly understood. Methods Fifty-eight COVID-19 patients post-hospital discharge and 30 age, sex, body mass index comorbidity-matched controls were enrolled for multiorgan (brain, lungs, heart, liver and kidneys) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), spirometry, six-minute walk test, cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET), quality of life, cognitive and mental health assessments. Findings At 2{\textendash}3 months from disease-onset, 64\% of patients experienced breathlessness and 55\% reported fatigue. On MRI, abnormalities were seen in lungs (60\%), heart (26\%), liver (10\%) and kidneys (29\%). Patients exhibited changes in the thalamus, posterior thalamic radiations and sagittal stratum on brain MRI and demonstrated impaired cognitive performance, specifically in the executive and visuospatial domains. Exercise tolerance (maximal oxygen consumption and ventilatory efficiency on CPET) and six-minute walk distance were significantly reduced. The extent of extra-pulmonary MRI abnormalities and exercise intolerance correlated with serum markers of inflammation and acute illness severity. Patients had a higher burden of self-reported symptoms of depression and experienced significant impairment in all domains of quality of life compared to controls (p{$<$}0.0001 to 0.044). Interpretation A significant proportion of patients discharged from hospital reported symptoms of breathlessness, fatigue, depression and had limited exercise capacity. Persistent lung and extra-pulmonary organ MRI findings are common in patients and linked to inflammation and severity of acute illness.

  abstract = {Genetic predisposition and sensitivity to environmental cues jointly give rise to maladaptive human behaviors, such as unhealthy eating. Despite the dramatic rise in obesity rates, the relationship between these factors is not well understood. Here we show that children genetically at risk for obesity exhibit stronger reward-related responses to real-world food cues (i.e., food advertisements) in the nucleus accumbens, a brain area canonically associated with reward processing. Additionally, this structure is larger in children at a higher risk for obesity. Taken together, these findings offer one explanation for how genetic risk for obesity may predispose individuals to engage in unhealthy eating behaviors and may inform strategies targeting early intervention.Obesity is a major public health concern that involves an interaction between genetic susceptibility and exposure to environmental cues (e.g., food marketing); however, the mechanisms that link these factors and contribute to unhealthy eating are unclear. Using a well-known obesity risk polymorphism (FTO rs9939609) in a sample of 78 children (ages 9{\textendash}12 y), we observed that children at risk for obesity exhibited stronger responses to food commercials in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) than children not at risk. Similarly, children at a higher genetic risk for obesity demonstrated larger NAcc volumes. Although a recessive model of this polymorphism best predicted body mass and adiposity, a dominant model was most predictive of NAcc size and responsivity to food cues. These findings suggest that children genetically at risk for obesity are predisposed to represent reward signals more strongly, which, in turn, may contribute to unhealthy eating behaviors later in life.}

We aimed to understand true brain change; examine the influence of salient risk factors that modify an individual's rate of cortical thinning; and compare cross-sectional age-related differences in cortical thickness to longitudinal within-person cortical thinning. We used Multivariate Multilevel Modeling to simultaneously model dependencies among 5 lobar composites (Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital, and Cingulate [CING]) and account for the longitudinal nature of the data. Results indicate (1) all 5 lobar composites significantly atrophied across 8 years, showing nonlinear longitudinal rate of cortical thinning decelerated over time, (2) longitudinal thinning was significantly altered by hypertension and~Apolipoprotein-E {$\epsilon$}4 (APOE{$\epsilon$}4), varying by location: Frontal and CING thinned more rapidly in APOE{$\epsilon$}4 carriers. Notably, thinning of parietal and occipital cortex showed synergistic effect of combined risk factors, where individuals who were both APOE{$\epsilon$}4 carriers and hypertensive had significantly greater 8-year thinning than those with either risk factor alone or neither risk factor, (3) longitudinal thinning was 3 times greater than cross-sectional estimates of age-related differences in thickness in parietal and occipital cortices.}

  abstract = {While neuropathological examinations in patients who died from COVID-19 revealed inflammatory changes in cerebral white matter, cerebral MRI frequently fails to detect abnormalities even in the presence of neurological symptoms. Application of multi-compartment diffusion microstructure imaging (DMI), that detects even small volume shifts between the compartments (intra-axonal, extra-axonal and free water/CSF) of a white matter model, is a promising approach to overcome this discrepancy.In this monocentric prospective study, a cohort of 20 COVID-19 inpatients (57.3\,{$\pm$}\,17.1 years) with neurological symptoms (e.g. delirium, cranial nerve palsies) and cognitive impairments measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA test; 22.4\,{$\pm$}\,4.9; 70\% below the cut-off value \&lt;26/30 points) underwent DMI in the subacute stage of the disease (29.3\,{$\pm$}\,14.8 days after positive PCR). A comparison of whole-brain white matter DMI parameters with a matched healthy control group (n\,=\,35) revealed a volume shift from the intra- and extra-axonal space into the free water fraction (V-CSF). This widespread COVID-related V-CSF increase affected the entire supratentorial white matter with maxima in frontal and parietal regions. Streamline-wise comparisons between COVID-19 patients and controls further revealed a network of most affected white matter fibres connecting widespread cortical regions in all cerebral lobes. The magnitude of these white matter changes (V-CSF) was associated with cognitive impairment measured by the MoCA test (r\,=\,-0.64, P\,=\,0.006) but not with olfactory performance (r\,=\,0.29, P\,=\,0.12). Furthermore, a non-significant trend for an association between V-CSF and interleukin-6 emerged (r\,=\,0.48, P\,=\,0.068), a prominent marker of the COVID-19 related inflammatory response. In 14/20 patients who also received cerebral 18F-FDG PET, V-CSF increase was associated with the expression of the previously defined COVID-19-related metabolic spatial covariance pattern (r\,=\,0.57; P\,=\,0.039). In addition, the frontoparietal-dominant pattern of neocortical glucose hypometabolism matched well to the frontal and parietal focus of V-CSF increase.In summary, DMI in subacute COVID-19 patients revealed widespread volume shifts compatible with vasogenic oedema, affecting various supratentorial white matter tracts. These changes were associated with cognitive impairment and COVID-19 related changes in 18F-FDG PET imaging.},

By contrast, in the same model, hyperhomocysteinemia was independently associated with AD (HR, 1.91; 95\%CI, 1.02{\textendash}3.56) but not VaD risk. Blood inflammatory markers are associated with increased VaD risk but do not predict AD, which seems selectively associated with hyperhomocysteinemia.},

Here, we describe epidemiological, clinical, genetic, immunological, histological and metabolic differences within T1DM that, together, suggest heterogeneity in its aetiology and pathogenesis.

  abstract = {Abstract In multicenter MRI studies, pooling of volumetric data requires a prior evaluation of compatibility between the different machines used. We tested the compatibility of five different scanners (2 General Electric Signa, 2 Siemens Symphony, and a Philips Gyroscan) at five different sites by repeating the scans of five volunteers at each of the sites. Using a semiautomatic method based on the Talairach atlas, and SPM algorithms for tissue segmentation (multimodal T1 and T2, or T1-only), we obtained volume measurements of the main brain lobes (frontal, parietal, occipital, temporal) and for each tissue type. Our results suggest that pooling of multisite data adds small error for whole brain measurements, intersite coefficient of variation (CV) ranging from 1.8 to 5.2\%, respectively, for GM and CSF. However, in the occipital lobe, intersite CV can be as high as 11.7\% for WM and 17.3\% for CSF. Compared with the intersite, intrasite CV values were always much lower. Whenever possible, T1 and T2 tissue segmentation methods should be used because they yield more consistent volume measurements between sites than T1-only, especially when some of the scans were obtained with different sequence parameters and pixel size from those of the other sites. Our study shows that highest compatibility among scanners would be obtained using equipments of the same manufacturer and also image acquisition parameters as similar as possible. After validation, data from a specific ROI or scanner showing values markedly different from the other sites might be excluded from the analysis. Hum Brain Mapp, 2009. ? 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Tractography was performed to reconstruct several white matter tracts. Diffusion tensor imaging measures, including fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD), were compared between groups and related to cognitive performance.RESULTS MD was significantly increased in all tracts in both hemispheres in patients compared with control subjects (P \&amp;lt; 0.05), reflecting microstructural white matter abnormalities in the diabetes group. Increased MD was associated with slowing of information-processing speed and worse memory performance in the diabetes but not in the control group after adjustment for age, sex, and estimated IQ (group {\texttimes} MD interaction, all P \&amp;lt; 0.05). These associations were independent of total white matter hyperintensity load and presence of cerebral infarcts.CONCLUSIONS Individuals with type 2 diabetes showed microstructural abnormalities in various white matter pathways. These abnormalities were related to worse cognitive functioning.}

Using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (PET) in the study of cognitively normal late middle-aged people, we demonstrated an association between apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon4 gene dose, the major genetic risk factor for late-onset AD, and lower measurements of the cerebral metabolic rate for glucose (CMRgl) in AD-affected brain regions, we proposed using PET as a pre-symptomatic endophenotype to evaluate other putative AD risk modifiers, and we then used it to support an aggregate cholesterol-related genetic risk score in the risk of AD. In the present study, we used PET to investigate the association between serum total cholesterol levels and cerebral metabolic rate for glucose metabolism (CMRgl) in 117 cognitively normal late middle-aged APOE epsilon4 homozygotes, heterozygotes and non-carriers. Higher serum total cholesterol levels were associated with lower CMRgl bilaterally in precuneus, parietotemporal and prefrontal regions previously found to be preferentially affected by AD, and in additional frontal regions previously found to be preferentially affected by normal aging. The associations were greater in APOE epsilon4 carriers than non-carriers in some of the AD-affected brain regions. We postulate that higher midlife serum total cholesterol levels accelerate brain processes associated with normal aging and conspire with other risk factors in the predisposition to AD. We propose using PET in proof-of-concept randomized controlled trials to rapidly evaluate the effects of midlife cholesterol-lowering treatments on the brain changes associated with normal aging and AD.

Epidemiological studies suggest that dysglycemia is a risk factor for cognitive impairment but the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms remain unclear. The objective of this study was to examine the relation of dysglycemia clinical categories (normal glucose tolerance (NGT), pre-diabetes, undiagnosed diabetes, known diabetes) with brain structure in older adults. We also assessed the relation between dysglycemia and cognitive performance. Design Cross-sectional and longitudinal cohort study. Setting Northern Manhattan (Washington Heights, Hamilton Heights, and Inwood). Participants Medicare recipients 65 years and older. Measurements Dysglycemia categories were based on HBA1c or history of type 2 diabetes (diabetes). Brain structure (brain infarcts, white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume, total gray matter volume, total white matter volume, total hippocampus volume) was assessed with brain magnetic resonance imaging; cognitive function (memory, language and visuospatial function, speed) was assessed with a validated neuropsychological battery. Results Dysglycemia, defined with HbA1c as a continuous variable or categorically as pre-diabetes and diabetes, was associated with a higher number of brain infarcts, WMH volume and decreased total white matter, gray matter and hippocampus volumes cross-sectionally, and a significant decline in gray matter volume longitudinally. Dysglycemia was also associated with lower performance in language, speed and visuospatial function although these associations were attenuated when adjusted for education, APOE-{$\epsilon$}4, ethnic group and vascular risk factors. Conclusion Our results suggest that dysglycemia affects brain structure and cognition even in elderly survivors, evidenced by higher cerebrovascular disease, lower white and gray matter volume, and worse language and visuospatial function and cognitive speed.},

However, it remains unclear if higher levels of HbA1c might also affect brain structure and function in healthy subjects. With the present study we therefore aimed to investigate the relationship between HbA1c levels and cognitive performance as well as white matter microstructure in healthy, young adults. To address this question, associations between HbA1c and cognitive measures (NIH Cognition Toolbox) as well as DTI-derived imaging measures of white matter microstructure were investigated in a publicly available sample of healthy, young adults as part of the Humane Connectome Project (n= 1206, mean age= 28.8 years, 45.5 \% male). We found that HbA1c levels (range 4.1-6.3\%) were significantly inversely correlated with measures of cognitive performance. Higher HbA1c levels were associated with significant and wide-spread reductions in fractional anisotropy (FA) controlling for age, sex, body-mass index and education. FA reductions were furthermore found to covary with measures of cognitive performance. The same pattern of results could be observed in analyses restricted to participants with HBA1c levels below 5.7\%. The present study demonstrates that low-grade HbA1c variation below diagnostic threshold for diabetes is related to both cognitive performance and white matter integrity in healthy, young adults. These findings highlight the detrimental impact of metabolic risk factors on brain physiology and underscore the importance of intensified preventive measures independent of the currently applied diagnostic HbA1c cut-off scores.}

  abstract = {``The Scaffolding Theory of Aging and Cognition (STAC)'', proposed in 2009, is a conceptual model of cognitive aging that integrated evidence from structural and functional neuroimaging to explain how the combined effects of adverse and compensatory neural processes produce varying levels of cognitive function. The model made clear and testable predictions about how different brain variables, both structural and functional, were related to cognitive function, focusing on the core construct of compensatory scaffolding. The present paper provides a revised model that integrates new evidence about the aging brain that has emerged since STAC was published 5~years ago. Unlike the original STAC model, STAC-r incorporates life-course factors that serve to enhance or deplete neural resources, thereby influencing the developmental course of brain structure and function, as well as cognition, over time. Life-course factors also influence compensatory processes that are engaged to meet cognitive challenge, and to ameliorate the adverse effects of structural and functional decline. The revised model is discussed in relation to recent lifespan and longitudinal data as well as emerging evidence about the effects of training interventions. STAC-r goes beyond the previous model by combining a life-span approach with a life-course approach to understand and predict cognitive status and rate of cognitive change over time.}

Furthermore, there is a growing appreciation of the potential utility of longitudinally acquired structural images and reliable image processing to evaluate disease modifying therapies. Challenges have been related to the variability that is inherent in the available cross-sectional processing tools, to the introduction of bias in longitudinal processing and to potential over-regularization. In this paper we introduce a novel longitudinal image processing framework, based on unbiased, robust, within-subject template creation, for automatic surface reconstruction and segmentation of brain MRI of arbitrarily many time points. We demonstrate that it is essential to treat all input images exactly the same as removing only interpolation asymmetries is not sufficient to remove processing bias. We successfully reduce variability and avoid over-regularization by initializing the processing in each time point with common information from the subject template. The presented results show a significant increase in precision and discrimination power while preserving the ability to detect large anatomical deviations; as such they hold great potential in clinical applications, e.g. allowing for smaller sample sizes or shorter trials to establish disease specific biomarkers or to quantify drug effects.},

Obese (n = 18, age = 28.7 {$\pm$} 8.3 years) and healthy control (n = 24, age = 27.4 {$\pm$} 6.3 years) women underwent diffusion weighted imaging.

Connectivity was lower in white matter tracts connecting insula, amygdala, prefrontal cortex (PFC), orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and striatum. Connectivity was greater between the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). This study indicates that lower white matter connectivity within white matter tracts of insula-fronto-striatal taste-reward circuitry are associated with obesity as well as greater connectivity within white matter tracts connecting the amygdala and ACC. The specificity of regions suggests sensory integration and reward processing are key associations that are altered in and might contribute to obesity.},

Similarly, medial temporal lobe atrophy is well-documented in aging and Alzheimer's disease and is associated with memory decline. Here, we assessed the relationship between lobar white matter hyperintensities, medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, and hippocampal memory in older adults. We collected MRI scans in a sample of 139 older adults without dementia (88 females, mean age (SD)~=~76.95 (10.61)). Participants were administered the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). Regression analyses tested for associations among medial temporal lobe subregional volumes, regional white matter hyperintensities and memory, while adjusting for age, sex, and education and correcting for multiple comparisons. Increased occipital white matter hyperintensities were related to worse RAVLT delayed recall performance, and to reduced CA1, dentate gyrus, perirhinal cortex (Brodmann area 36), and parahippocampal cortex volumes. These medial temporal lobe subregional volumes were related to delayed recall performance. The association of occipital white matter hyperintensities with delayed recall performance was fully mediated statistically only by perirhinal cortex volume. These results suggest that white matter hyperintensities may be associated with memory decline through their impact on medial temporal lobe atrophy. These findings provide new insights into the role of vascular pathologies in memory loss in older adults and suggest that future studies should further examine the neural mechanisms of these relationships in longitudinal samples.},

Although evidence supports dissociable contributions of D1- and D2-type receptors to response inhibition in rats and associations of D2-type receptors to response inhibition in humans, the relationship between D1-type receptors and response inhibition has not been evaluated in humans. Here, we tested whether individual differences in striatal D1- and D2-type receptors are related to response inhibition in human subjects, possibly in opposing ways. Thirty-one volunteers participated. Response inhibition was indexed by stop-signal reaction time on the stop-signal task and commission errors on the continuous performance task, and tested for association with striatal D1- and D2-type receptor availability [binding potential referred to nondisplaceable uptake (BPND)], measured using positron emission tomography with [(11)C]NNC-112 and [(18)F]fallypride, respectively. Stop-signal reaction time was negatively correlated with D1- and D2-type BPND in whole striatum, with significant relationships involving the dorsal striatum, but not the ventral striatum, and no significant correlations involving the continuous performance task. The results indicate that dopamine D1- and D2-type receptors are associated with response inhibition, and identify the dorsal striatum as an important locus of dopaminergic control in stopping. Moreover, the similar contribution of both receptor subtypes suggests the importance of a relative balance between phasic and tonic dopaminergic activity subserved by D1- and D2-type receptors, respectively, in support of response inhibition. The results also suggest that the stop-signal task and the continuous performance task use different neurochemical mechanisms subserving motor response inhibition.},

However, in healthy adults, the relationship between memory and regional volumes is unclear, and no data are available on the relationship of longitudinal regional shrinkage to memory performance in a cognitively intact population. The objective of this study was to examine whether shrinkage of the EC, HC, and PFC over a 5 year period can predict declarative memory performance in healthy adults. The volumes of three brain regions were measured on magnetic resonance images that were acquired twice, 5 years apart. Multiple measures of episodic memory were administered at follow-up. Results indicated that the volume of HC and PFC (but not EC) correlated with age at baseline and follow-up. However, after age differences in memory were taken into account, none of the regional volumes was associated with memory performance at follow-up. In contrast, greater annual rate of shrinkage in EC (but not HC or PFC) predicted poorer memory performance. Thus, in a healthy and educated population, even mild age-related shrinkage of the EC may be a sensitive predictor of memory decline.}

  abstract = {\emph{Introduction:} Previous studies have associated a decreased striatal D2 dopamine receptor (DRD2) binding with impaired performance in cognitive tasks. In vivo studies have found a lower DRD2 binding associated with the CC genotype of the C957T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the \emph{DRD2} gene. \emph{Objective: }The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between executive functions and the C957T \emph{DRD2} SNP. We hypothesized that the CC genotype would be associated with a poorer executive functioning. \emph{Methods:} Our sample consisted of 83 healthy volunteers (28 males and 55 females; mean age 25.2, SD 1.7 years). To assess executive functions, the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test was used, considering the variables perseverative errors, perseverative responses, and number of categories achieved. The genotype distribution was 13 CC, 41 CT, and29 TT, satisfying Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. \emph{Results:} Carriers of the CC genotype, compared with carriers of the CT/TT genotypes, achieved significantly fewer categories (5.00 vs. 5.81; p = 0.004), made a greater number of perseverative errors (13.46 vs. 8.39; p = 0.018), and had a greater number of perseverative responses (14.92 vs. 8.94; p = 0.014). \emph{Conclusions:} Our results support the hypothesis that the C957T \emph{DRD2} SNP may influence cognitive performance through its repercussions on central dopaminergic function.}

  abstract = {The prevalence rate of obesity continues to rise in the U.S., but effective treatment options remain elusive resulting in increased emphasis on prevention. One such area of prevention research capitalizes on the relatively novel behavioral construct of food addiction, which has been implicated in obesity. Food addiction reflects an individual's propensity for compulsive eating despite negative consequences, and shares not only symptoms with both eating and substance use disorders but also genetic and neural correlates within neural reward-circuitry modulated by dopamine. Here, we examined associations between food addiction scores, body mass index (BMI), reward-related ventral striatum activity, and a polygenic score approximating dopamine signaling in 115 non-Hispanic Caucasian young adult university students. As predicted, polygenic dopamine scores were related to ventral striatum activity, which in turn was associated with higher food addiction scores. In addition, food addiction was related to BMI. An exploratory post-hoc path analysis further indicated that polygenic scores were indirectly related to both food addiction and BMI, in part, through ventral striatum activity. Collectively, our results provide evidence supporting the utility of food addiction in weight gain prevention research by establishing links with known risk-related neural and genetic biomarkers.},

A 5?mm midventricular axial slice was sampled using a modified Look?Locker technique with 1.5 mm in?plane resolution, and 32 time points post?adiabatic inversion. The results confirmed that for most brain tissues, T1 values increased by more than a factor of 3 between 0.2T and 7T, and over this range were well fitted by T1 (s) = 0.583(B0)0.382, T1(s) = 0.857(B0)0.376, and T1(s) = 1.35(B0)0.340 for white matter (WM), internal GM, and blood 1H2O, respectively. The ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 1H2O T1 value did not change with B0, and its average value (standard deviation (SD)) across subjects and magnetic fields was 4.3 ({$\pm$}0.2) s. The tissue 1/T1 values at each field were well correlated with the macromolecular mass fraction, and to a lesser extent tissue iron content. The field?dependent increases in 1H2O T1 values more than offset the well?known decrease in typical MRI contrast reagent (CR) relaxivity, and simulations predict that this leads to lower CR concentration detection thresholds with increased magnetic field.

Methods A meta-analysis and systematic review was performed investigating associations between baseline WMHs and longitudinal cognitive outcomes in cognitively normal populations, and populations with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), Alzheimer's disease (AD), and stroke. Results Baseline WMHs increase the risk of cognitive impairment and dementia across diagnostic categories and most consistently in MCI and post-stroke populations. Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype and domain-specific cognitive changes relating to strategic anatomical locations, such as frontal WMH and executive decline, represent important considerations. Meta-analysis reliability was assessed using multiple methods of estimation, and results suggest that heterogeneity in study design and reporting remains a significant barrier. Discussion Recommendations and future directions for study of WMHs are provided to improve cross-study comparison and translation of research into consistent clinical interpretation.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) and dementia are a global public health priority, and prevention has been highlighted as a pivotal component in managing the dementia epidemic. Modifiable risk factors of dementia and AD include lifestyle-related factors, vascular and metabolic disorders, and psychosocial factors. Randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) are needed to clarify whether modifying such factors can prevent or postpone cognitive impairment and dementia in older adults. Given the complex, multifactorial, and heterogeneous nature of late-onset AD and dementia, interventions targeting several risk factors and mechanisms simultaneously may be required for optimal preventive effects. The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) is the first large, long-term RCT to demonstrate that a multidomain lifestyle-based intervention ameliorating vascular and lifestyle-related risk factors can preserve cognitive functioning and reduce the risk of cognitive decline among older adults at increased risk of dementia. To investigate the multidomain intervention in other populations and diverse cultural and geographical settings, the World-Wide FINGERS (WW-FINGERS) network was recently launched (https://alz.org/wwfingers). Within this network, new FINGER-type trials with shared core methodology, but local culture and context-specific adaptations, will be conducted in several countries. The WW-FINGERS initiative facilitates international collaborations, provides a platform for testing multidomain strategies to prevent cognitive impairment and dementia, and aims at generating high-quality scientific evidence to support public health and clinical decision-making. Furthermore, the WW-FINGERS network can support the implementation of preventive strategies and translation of research findings into practice.}

While an overall association between WMH load and risk factors is well described, possible spatially restricted vulnerability remains to be established. The aim of this study was to investigate the spatial distribution of WMH in normally functioning elderly subjects. We introduce a voxel-based approach in which lesion probability is mapped as a function of clinical risk factors using logistic regression, and validate the method using simulated datasets. The method was then applied in a total of 605 participants of the LADIS study (age 74{$\pm$}5years, all with WMH), and the location of manually delineated WMH was investigated after spatial normalisation. Particularly strong and widespread associations were found for age, gender and hypertension. Different distribution patterns were found for men and women. Further, increased probability was found in association with self-reported alcohol and tobacco consumption, as well as in those with a history of migraine. It is concluded that the location of WMH is dependent on the risk factors involved pointing towards a regionally different pathogenesis and/or vulnerability of the white matter.},

In 40,441 person-years of follow-up (mean 5.7 years) we identified 395 new cases of dementia (overall incidence: 9.8 per 1,000 person-years). Alzheimer's disease was the most frequent subtype of dementia (293 cases; 7.2 per 1,000). Vascular dementia was diagnosed in 57 participants (1.5 per 1,000). Overall, dementia incidence was similar for men and women (rate ratio women versus men: 1.00, 95\% CI: 0.80{\textendash}1.24). However, after 90 years of age dementia incidence declined in men but not in women (rate ratio 2.61, 95\% CI: 1.04{\textendash}6.56), in particular for Alzheimer's disease (rate ratio 5.79, 95\% CI: 1.40{\textendash}23.90).

Voxel-by-voxel regression analyses revealed that all GMD and WMD changes were well associated with elevated regional homogeneity of spontaneous neural activity (ReHo) in blood-oxygenation level-dependent signals.

Design Longitudinal study. Setting The population-based Leiden 85-plus Study. Participants Five hundred seventy-two 85-year-old community-dwelling individuals. Measurements BP was measured at age 85 during home visits. Activities of daily living (ADLs) and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) were assessed at age 85 and annually thereafter up to age 90. On average, participants were followed for 3.2~years. Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were performed using linear regression models using systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and pulse pressure (PP) as the determinants. All analyses were adjusted for sociodemographic and cardiovascular factors. Results At age 85, higher SBP and PP were associated with lower ADL disability scores (both P~=~.01). Similarly, higher SBP, DBP, and MAP were associated with higher MMSE scores (all P~{$<~$}.05). From age 85 onward, higher SBP (P~{$<~$}.001), MAP (P~=~.01), and PP (P~=~.003) at age 85 were associated with lower annual increases in ADL disability scores. Likewise, higher SBP (P~=~.03) and PP (P~=~.008) at age 85 were associated with lower annual declines in MMSE scores. Additional analyses showed that the association between high BP and lower annual decline in MMSE score was most pronounced in participants with high ADL disability. Conclusion In the oldest old, higher SBP and PP are associated with resilience to physical and cognitive decline, especially in individuals with pre-existing physical disability.},

  abstract = {The brain is not idle during rest. Functional MRI (fMRI) studies have identified several resting-state networks, including the default mode network (DMN), which contains a set of cortical regions that interact with a hippocampus (HC) subsystem. Age-related alterations in the functional architecture of the DMN and HC may influence memory functions and possibly constitute a sensitive biomarker of forthcoming memory deficits. However, the exact form of DMN-HC alterations in aging and concomitant memory deficits is largely unknown. Here, using both task and resting data from 339 participants (25-80 y old), we have demonstrated age-related decrements in resting-state functional connectivity across most parts of the DMN, except for the HC network for which age-related elevation of connectivity between left and right HC was found along with attenuated HC-cortical connectivity. Elevated HC connectivity at rest, which was partly accounted for by age-related decline in white matter integrity of the fornix, was associated with lower cross-sectional episodic memory performance and declining longitudinal memory performance over 20 y. Additionally, elevated HC connectivity at rest was associated with reduced HC neural recruitment and HC-cortical connectivity during active memory encoding, which suggests that strong HC connectivity restricts the degree to which the HC interacts with other brain regions during active memory processing revealed by task fMRI. Collectively, our findings suggest a model in which age-related disruption in cortico-hippocampal functional connectivity leads to a more functionally isolated HC at rest, which translates into aberrant hippocampal decoupling and deficits during mnemonic processing.},

One such network is located in the medial temporal lobe (MTL), showing structural and functional variations along the anterior{\textendash}posterior axis. Past cross-sectional studies of MTL functional connectivity (FC) have yielded discrepant findings, likely reflecting the fact that specific MTL subregions are differentially affected in aging. Here, using longitudinal resting-state data from 198 participants, we investigated 5-year changes in FC of the anterior and posterior MTL. We found an opposite pattern, such that the degree of FC within the anterior MTL declined after age 60, whereas elevated FC within the posterior MTL was observed along with attenuated posterior MTL-cortical connectivity. A significant negative change{\textendash}change relation was observed between episodic-memory decline and elevated FC in the posterior MTL. Additional analyses revealed age-related cerebral blood flow (CBF) increases in posterior MTL at the follow-up session, along with a positive relation of elevated FC and~CBF, suggesting that elevated FC is a metabolically demanding alteration. Collectively, our findings indicate that elevated FC in posterior MTL along with increased local perfusion is a sign of brain aging that underlie episodic-memory decline.}

  abstract = {Episodic memory declines with advancing age. Neuroimaging studies have associated such decline to age-related changes in general cognitive-control networks as well as to changes in process-specific encoding or retrieval networks. To assess the specific influence of aging on encoding and retrieval processes and associated brain systems, it is vital to dissociate encoding and retrieval from each other and from shared cognitive-control processes. We used multivariate partial-least-squares to analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a large population-based sample (n = 292, 25{\textendash}80 years). The participants performed a face-name paired-associates task and an active baseline task. The analysis revealed two significant network patterns. The first reflected a process-general encoding-retrieval network that included frontoparietal cortices and posterior hippocampus. The second pattern dissociated encoding and retrieval networks. The anterior hippocampus was differentially engaged during encoding. Brain scores, representing whole-brain integrated measures of how strongly an individual recruited a brain network, were correlated with cognitive performance and chronological age. The scores from the general cognitive-control network correlated negatively with episodic memory performance and positively with age. The encoding brain scores, which strongly reflected hippocampal functioning, correlated positively with episodic memory performance and negatively with age. Univariate analyses confirmed that bilateral hippocampus showed the most pronounced activity reduction in older age, and brain structure analyses found that the activity reduction partly related to hippocampus atrophy. Collectively, these findings suggest that age-related structural brain changes underlie age-related reductions in the efficient recruitment of a process-specific encoding network, which cascades into upregulated recruitment of a general cognitive-control network.}

The definition of new approaches for the design of proper clinical trials is highly demanded in order to achieve non-confounding results and assess more effective treatment. In this study, a cohort of 200 subjects was obtained from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Subjects were followed-up for 24 months, and classified as AD (50), progressive-MCI to AD (50), stable-MCI (50), and cognitively normal (50). Structural T1-weighted MRI brain studies and neuropsychological measures of these subjects were used to train and optimize an artificial-intelligence classifier to distinguish mild-AD patients who need treatment (AD + pMCI) from subjects who do not need treatment (sMCI + CN). The classifier was able to distinguish between the two groups 24 months before AD definite diagnosis using a combination of MRI brain studies and specific neuropsychological measures, with 85\% accuracy, 83\% sensitivity, and 87\% specificity. The combined-approach model outperformed the classification using MRI data alone (72\% classification accuracy, 69\% sensitivity, and 75\% specificity). The patterns of morphological abnormalities localized in the temporal pole and medial-temporal cortex might be considered as biomarkers of clinical progression and evolution. These regions can be already observed 24 months before AD definite diagnosis. The best neuropsychological predictors mainly included measures of functional abilities, memory and learning, working memory, language, visuoconstructional reasoning, and complex attention, with a particular focus on some of the sub-scores of the FAQ and AVLT tests.}

However, the pathogenesis of WMH remains poorly understood. We observed that regions of reduced cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) in the white matter of young individuals correspond to the regions most susceptible to WMH in the elderly. This finding prompted us to consider that reduced CVR may play a role in the pathogenesis of WMH. We hypothesized that reduced CVR precedes development of WMH. Methods We examined 45 subjects (age range?=?50?91 years; 25 males) with moderate?severe WMH, and measured their baseline CVR using the blood oxygen level?dependent magnetic resonance imaging signal response to a standardized step change in the end-tidal partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Diffusion tensor imaging and transverse relaxation time (T2) relaxometry were performed at baseline and 1-year follow-up, with automated coregistration between time points. Baseline fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), T2, and CVR were measured in areas that progressed from normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) to WMH over the 1-year period.

In this review, we examine the role played in homeostatic regulation of feeding by systemic mediators such as leptin and ghrelin, which act on brain systems utilizing neuropeptide Y, agouti-related peptide, melanocortins, orexins, and melanin concentrating hormone, among other mediators. We also examine the mechanisms for taste and reward systems that provide food with its intrinsically reinforcing properties and explore the links between the homeostatic and hedonic systems that ensure intake of adequate nutrition.}

Mendelian randomization suggested causal association of increasing WMH-volume with stroke, Alzheimer-type dementia, and of increasing blood pressure (BP) with larger WMH-volume, notably also in persons without clinical hypertension. Transcriptome-wide colocalization analyses showed association of WMH-volume with expression of 39 genes, of which four encode known drug targets. Finally, we provide insight into BP-independent biological pathways underlying SVD and suggest potential for genetic stratification of high-risk individuals and for genetically-informed prioritization of drug targets for prevention trials.},

  abstract = {It has recently been reported (Van Dijk et al., 2011) that in-scanner head motion can have a substantial impact on MRI measurements of resting-state functional connectivity. This finding may be of particular relevance for studies of neurodevelopment in youth, confounding analyses to the extent that motion and subject age are related. Furthermore, while Van Dijk et al. demonstrated the effect of motion on seed-based connectivity analyses, it is not known how motion impacts other common measures of connectivity. Here we expand on the findings of Van Dijk et al. by examining the effect of motion on multiple types of resting-state connectivity analyses in a large sample of children and adolescents (n=456). Following replication of the effect of motion on seed-based analyses, we examine the influence of motion on graphical measures of network modularity, dual-regression of independent component analysis, as well as the amplitude and fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuation. In the entire sample, subject age was highly related to motion. Using a subsample where age and motion were unrelated, we demonstrate that motion has marked effects on connectivity in every analysis examined. While subject age was associated with increased within-network connectivity even when motion was accounted for, controlling for motion substantially attenuated the strength of this relationship. The results demonstrate the pervasive influence of motion on multiple types functional connectivity analysis, and underline the importance of accounting for motion in studies of neurodevelopment.},

  abstract = {Sex differences in human cognition are marked, but little is known regarding their neural origins. Here, in a sample of 674 human participants ages 9-22, we demonstrate that sex differences in cognitive profiles are related to multivariate patterns of resting-state functional connectivity MRI (rsfc-MRI). Males outperformed females on motor and spatial cognitive tasks; females were faster in tasks of emotion identification and nonverbal reasoning. Sex differences were also prominent in the rsfc-MRI data at multiple scales of analysis, with males displaying more between-module connectivity, while females demonstrated more within-module connectivity. Multivariate pattern analysis using support vector machines classified subject sex on the basis of their cognitive profile with 63\% accuracy (P {$<$} 0.001), but was more accurate using functional connectivity data (71\% accuracy; P {$<$} 0.001). Moreover, the degree to which a given participant's cognitive profile was "male" or "female" was significantly related to the masculinity or femininity of their pattern of brain connectivity (P = 2.3 x 10(-7)). This relationship was present even when considering males and female separately. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that sex differences in patterns of cognition are in part represented on a neural level through divergent patterns of brain connectivity.},

We sought to investigate the association between MeDi and MRI infarcts. Methods: High-resolution structural MRI was collected on 707 elderly 65 years or older community residents of New York with available dietary assessments administered an average of 5.8 years (3.22 standard deviations [SDs]) before the MRI. Participants were divided into 3 groups of adherence to MeDi (low, middle, and high tertiles). We examined the association of increasing adherence to MeDi with presence of infarcts on MRI. Models were run without adjustment, adjusted for basic demographic and clinical factors, and adjusted for vascular risk factors. Results: A total of 222 participants had at least 1 infarct. In the unadjusted model, compared to the low adherence group, those in the moderate MeDi adherence group had a 22\% reduced odds of having an infarct (odds ratio [OR], 0.78; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.55?1.14), while participants in the highest MeDi adherence group had a 36\% reduced odds (OR, 0.64; 95\% CI, 0.42?0.97; p for trend = 0.04). In adjusted models, the association between MeDi adherence and MRI infarcts remained essentially unchanged. The association of high MeDi adherence with infarcts was comparable to that of hypertension (40\% reduced probability), did not vary by infarct size or after excluding patients with dementia (n = 46) or clinical strokes (n = 86). There was no association between MeDi and white matter hyperintensities. Interpretation: Higher adherence to the MeDi is associated with reduced cerebrovascular disease burden. Ann Neurol 2011}

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To test whether elevated blood pressure (BP) relates to gray matter (GM) volume (GMV) changes in young adults who had not previously been diagnosed with hypertension (systolic BP [SBP]/diastolic BP [DBP] {$>$}/=140/90 mm Hg). METHODS: We associated BP with GMV from structural 3T T1-weighted MRI of 423 healthy adults between 19 and 40 years of age (mean age 27.7 +/- 5.3 years, 177 women, SBP/DBP 123.2/73.4 +/- 12.2/8.5 mm Hg). Data originated from 4 previously unpublished cross-sectional studies conducted in Leipzig, Germany. We performed voxel-based morphometry on each study separately and combined results in image-based meta-analyses (IBMA) to assess cumulative effects across studies. Resting BP was assigned to 1 of 4 categories: (1) SBP {$<$}120 and DBP {$<$}80 mm Hg, (2) SBP 120-129 or DBP 80-84 mm Hg, (3) SBP 130-139 or DBP 85-89 mm Hg, (4) SBP {$>$}/=140 or DBP {$>$}/=90 mm Hg. RESULTS: IBMA yielded the following results: (1) lower regional GMV was correlated with higher peripheral BP; (2) lower GMV was found with higher BP when comparing individuals in subhypertensive categories 3 and 2, respectively, to those in category 1; (3) lower BP-related GMV was found in regions including hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, frontal, and parietal structures (e.g., precuneus). CONCLUSION: BP {$>$}/=120/80 mm Hg was associated with lower GMV in regions that have previously been related to GM decline in older individuals with manifest hypertension. Our study shows that BP-associated GM alterations emerge continuously across the range of BP and earlier in adulthood than previously assumed. This suggests that treating hypertension or maintaining lower BP in early adulthood might be essential for preventing the pathophysiologic cascade of asymptomatic cerebrovascular disease to symptomatic end-organ damage, such as stroke or dementia.}

  abstract = {Summary Impulsivity towards food has been recognized as a potential factor leading to increased food intake in obesity. Patients suffering from binge eating disorder (BED) form a specific subgroup of obese people that might be characterized by increased impulsivity. These assumptions, although, have yet to be verified. Therefore, this review evaluates evidence for food-related impulsivity in obese people with and without BED and examines possible differences between both populations. More precisely, evidence for the two components of impulsivity is analyzed separately: evidence for reward sensitivity, specifically, the urge for appetitive stimuli and evidence for rash-spontaneous behaviour such as acting disinhibited with no regard for the consequences. Our search resulted in 51 articles demonstrating generally increased food-related impulsivity. We found particular emphasis on increased reward sensitivity in obese people, which appeared to be more pronounced in people with BED. There was little and conflicting evidence, however, concerning increased rash-spontaneous behaviour in obese people without BED, but consistent evidence of an increase in obese people with BED. All in all, the evidence supports the view that BED represents a specific phenotype of obesity with increased food-related impulsivity. Taking these specific deficits into account can enhance the effectiveness of weight reduction programmes and psychotherapy.},

Risk factors associated with the longitudinal progression of WMH in the general population have not been systematically investigated. To investigate the primary midlife and current cardiometabolic risk factors associated with changes in WMH over time in a population cohort. Methods- This cohort study included participants enrolled in the Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, a longitudinal population-based study in Olmsted County, Minnesota with at least 2 consecutive WMH assessments on fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-magnetic resonance images (n=554, {$>$}/=60 years with midlife assessments) with relevant baseline laboratory measures of interest. Linear mixed model regression was used to determine the important components of cardiometabolic risk profile at baseline that were associated with future progression of WMH. These analyses were controlled for age and sex. Sensitivity analyses were conducted using stratification by sex. The main outcome measure was percent change in WMH normalized to total intracranial volume. Three sets of models were constructed to evaluate individual (1) midlife risk factors, (2) current risk factors including the presence of metabolic syndrome and its constituents, and (3) baseline measurements of continuous laboratory measures of cardiometabolic risk. Results- Age was the strongest predictor of progression in WMH (P{$<$}0.001). Baseline hypertension (P{$<$}0.001), midlife hypertension (P=0.003), and baseline fasting glucose in males (P=0.01) were predictive of WMH change. The presence of metabolic syndrome was not associated with progressive WMH. In sensitivity analyses, associations between hypertension and WMH progression were stronger in females. Baseline serum glucose was associated with increase in WMH but was not significant in females in the stratified analysis. Other continuous laboratory measures of vascular risk were not associated with progressive WMH. Conclusions- Midlife and current hypertension in all participants and fasting glucose in males were associated with quantitative changes in white matter. Prospective clinical studies should determine optimal blood pressure to reduce stroke and cognitive impairment during aging.},

  abstract = {IntroductionThe menopause transition is associated with several cardiometabolic risk factors. Poor cardiometabolic health is further linked to microvascular brain lesions, which can be detected as white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) using T2-FLAIR magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Females show higher risk for WMHs post-menopause, but it remains unclear whether changes in cardiometabolic risk factors underlie menopause-related increase in brain pathology.MethodsIn this study, we assessed whether cross-sectional measures of cardiometabolic health, including body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), blood lipids, blood pressure, and long-term blood glucose (HbA1c), as well as longitudinal changes in BMI and WHR, differed according to menopausal status at baseline in 9,882 UK Biobank females (age range 40{\textendash}70 years, n premenopausal = 3,529, n postmenopausal = 6,353). Furthermore, we examined whether these cardiometabolic factors were associated with WMH outcomes at the follow-up assessment, on average 8.78 years after baseline.ResultsPostmenopausal females showed higher levels of baseline blood lipids (HDL {$\beta$}\,=\,0.14, p\,{$<$}\,0.001, LDL {$\beta$}\,=\,0.20, p\,{$<$}\,0.001, triglycerides {$\beta$}\,=\,0.12, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) and HbA1c ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.24, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) compared to premenopausal women, beyond the effects of age. Over time, BMI increased more in the premenopausal compared to the postmenopausal group ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.08, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), while WHR increased to a similar extent in both groups ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.03, p\,=\,0.102). The change in WHR was however driven by increased waist circumference only in the premenopausal group. While the group level changes in BMI and WHR were in general small, these findings point to distinct anthropometric changes in pre- and postmenopausal females over time. Higher baseline measures of BMI, WHR, triglycerides, blood pressure, and HbA1c, as well as longitudinal increases in BMI and WHR, were associated with larger WMH volumes ({$\beta$} range = 0.03{\textendash}0.13, p\,{$\leq$}\,0.002). HDL showed a significant inverse relationship with WMH volume ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.27, p\,{$<$}\,0.001).DiscussionOur findings emphasise the importance of monitoring cardiometabolic risk factors in females from midlife through the menopause transition and into the postmenopausal phase, to ensure improved cerebrovascular outcomes in later years.},

To benefit from the sub-millimeter resolution requires an improved segmentation procedure. The traditional anatomical landmarks of the hypothalamus were refined using 7T T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. A detailed segmentation algorithm (unilateral hypothalamus) was developed for colour-coded, histogram-matched images, and evaluated in a sample of 10 subjects. Test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities were estimated in terms of intraclass-correlation coefficients (ICC) and Dice's coefficient (DC). The computer-assisted segmentation algorithm ensured test-retest reliabilities of ICC{$\geq$}.97 (DC{$\geq$}96.8) and inter-rater reliabilities of ICC{$\geq$}.94 (DC = 95.2). There were no significant volume differences between the segmentation runs, raters, and hemispheres. The estimated volumes of the hypothalamus lie within the range of previous histological and neuroimaging results. We present a computer-assisted algorithm for the manual segmentation of the human hypothalamus using T1-weighted 7T magnetic resonance imaging. Providing very high test-retest and inter-rater reliabilities, it outperforms former procedures established at 1.5T and 3T magnetic resonance images and thus can serve as a gold standard for future automated procedures.}

  abstract = {Longitudinal analysis of white matter lesion changes on serial MRI has become an important parameter to study diseases with white-matter lesions. Here, we build on earlier work on cross-sectional lesion segmentation; we present a fully automatic pipeline for serial analysis of FLAIR-hyperintense white matter lesions. Our algorithm requires three-dimensional gradient echo T1- and FLAIR- weighted images at 3 Tesla as well as available cross-sectional lesion segmentations of both time points. Preprocessing steps include lesion filling and intrasubject registration. For segmentation of lesion changes, initial lesion maps of different time points are fused; herein changes in intensity are analyzed at the voxel level. Significance of lesion change is estimated by comparison with the difference distribution of FLAIR intensities within normal appearing white matter. The method is validated on MRI data of two time points from 40 subjects with multiple sclerosis derived from two different scanners (20 subjects per scanner). Manual segmentation of lesion increases served as gold standard. Across all lesion increases, voxel-wise Dice coefficient (0.7) as well as lesion-wise detection rate (0.8) and false-discovery rate (0.2) indicate good overall performance. Analysis of scans from a repositioning experiment in a single patient with multiple sclerosis did not yield a single false positive lesion. We also introduce the lesion change plot as a descriptive tool for the lesion change of individual patients with regard to both number and volume. An open source implementation of the algorithm is available at http://www.statistical-modeling.de/lst.html.},

  abstract = {Abstract MRI has become an indispensable tool for brain volumetric studies, with the hippocampus an important region of interest. Automation of the MRI segmentation process has helped advance the field by facilitating the volumetric analysis of larger cohorts and more studies. FreeSurfer has emerged as the de facto standard tool for these analyses, but studies validating its output are all based on older versions. To characterize FreeSurfer's validity, we compare several versions of FreeSurfer software with traditional hand-tracing. Using MRI images of 262 males and 402 females aged 38 to 84, we directly compare estimates of hippocampal volume from multiple versions of FreeSurfer, its hippocampal subfield routines, and our manual tracing protocol. We then use those estimates to assess asymmetry and atrophy, comparing performance of different estimators with each other and with brain atrophy measures. FreeSurfer consistently reports larger volumes than manual tracing. This difference is smaller in larger hippocampi or older people, with these biases weaker in version 6.0.0 than prior versions. All methods tested agree qualitatively on rightward asymmetry and increasing atrophy in older people. FreeSurfer saves time and money, and approximates the same atrophy measures as manual tracing, but it introduces biases that could require statistical adjustments in some studies.},

  abstract = {Making healthy food choices is challenging for many people. Individuals differ greatly in their ability to follow health goals in the face of temptation, but it is unclear what underlies such differences. Using voxel-based morphometry, we investigated in healthy humans (i.e., men and women) the links between structural variation in gray matter volume and individuals' level of success in shifting toward healthier food choices. We combined MRI and choice data into a joint dataset by pooling across three independent studies that used a task prompting participants to explicitly focus on the healthiness of food items before making their food choices. Within this dataset, we found that individual differences in gray matter volume in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) predicted regulatory success. We extended and confirmed these initial findings by predicting regulatory success out of sample and across tasks in a second dataset requiring participants to apply a different regulation strategy that entailed distancing from cravings for unhealthy, appetitive foods. Our findings suggest that neuroanatomical markers in the vmPFC and dlPFC generalized to different forms of dietary regulation strategies across participant groups. They provide novel evidence that structural differences in neuroanatomy of two key regions for valuation and its control, the vmPFC and dlPFC, predict an individual's ability to exert control in dietary choices.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Dieting involves regulating food choices to eat healthier foods and fewer unhealthy foods. People differ dramatically in their ability to achieve or maintain this regulation, but it is unclear why. Here, we show that individuals with more gray matter volume in the dorsolateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortex are better at exercising dietary self-control. This relationship was observed across four different studies examining two different forms of dietary self-regulation, suggesting that neuroanatomical differences in the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex may represent a general marker for self-control abilities. These results identify candidate neuroanatomical markers for dieting success and failure, and suggest potential targets for therapies aimed at preventing or treating obesity and related eating disorders.},

Three-hundred twenty-nine elderly community-dwelling volunteers underwent serial magnetic resonance imaging scanning and cognitive testing at baseline and at 3- and 6-year follow-up. We measured the changes in white matter lesion and brain parenchymal volumes. After 6 years, the median increase in white matter lesion load was 0.2cm3 (interquartile range [IQR], 0.0?0.80cm3) with a maximum of 31.4cm3. The median loss of brain volume was 2.3\% (IQR, 1.13?3.58\%). Increasing white matter lesion volume was correlated with loss of brain volume (p {$<$} 0.0001) and performance decline in tests of memory (p = 0.022), conceptualization (p = 0.046), and visuopractical skills (p = 0.005). Associations between changes in white matter lesion load and cognitive functioning were no longer significant when adding change in brain volume to the models, suggesting that cognitive decline related directly to loss of brain substance with progression of lesion burden.

Materials and Methods Data were generated via computer simulation. Components were added to a varying number of subjects between 1 and 20, and intersubject variability was simulated for both the added sources and their associated time courses. Three methods of group ICA analyses were performed: across-subject averaging, subject-wise concatenation, and row-wise concatenation (e.g., across time courses). Results Concatenating across subjects provided the best overall performance in terms of accurate estimation of the sources and associated time courses. Averaging across subjects provided accurate estimation (R {$>$} 0.9) of the time courses when the sources were present in a sufficient fraction (about 15\%) of 100 subjects. Concatenating across time courses was shown not to be a feasible method when unique sources were added to the data from each subject, simulating the effects of motion and susceptibility artifacts. Conclusion Subject-wise concatenation should be used when computationally feasible. For studies involving a large number of subjects, across-subject averaging provides an acceptable alternative and reduces the computational load. J. Magn. Reson.

However, across-center differences in contrast sensitivity, spatial uniformity, etc., may lead to tissue classification or image registration differences that could reduce or wholly offset the enhanced statistical power of multicenter data. Prior work has validated volumetric multicenter MRI, but robust methods for assessing reliability and power of multisite analyses with voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and cortical thickness measurement (CORT) are not yet available. We developed quantitative methods to investigate the reproducibility of VBM and CORT to detect group differences and estimate heritability when MRI scans from different scanners running different acquisition protocols in a multicenter setup are included. The method produces brain maps displaying information such as lowest detectable effect size (or heritability) and effective number of subjects in the multicenter study. We applied the method to a five-site multicenter calibration study using scanners from four different manufacturers, running different acquisition protocols. The reliability maps showed an overall good comparability between the sites, providing a reasonable gain in sensitivity in most parts of the brain. In large parts of the cerebrum and cortex scan pooling improved heritability estimates, with ?effective-N? values upto the theoretical maximum. For some areas, ?optimal-pool? maps indicated that leaving out a site would give better results. The reliability maps also reveal which brain regions are in any case difficult to measure reliably (e.g., around the thalamus). These tools will facilitate the design and analysis of multisite VBM and CORT studies for detecting group differences and estimating heritability. Hum Brain Mapp, 2010. ? 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Methods: The study includes older persons who agreed to annual clinical evaluation and brain donation. We examined the neuropathologic diagnoses, including Alzheimer disease (AD) (NIA-Reagan Criteria), cerebral infarctions, and Parkinson disease/Lewy body disease (PD/LBD), in the first 141 autopsies. We calculated the frequency of each diagnosis alone and mixed diagnoses. We used logistic regression to compare one to multiple diagnoses on the odds of dementia. Results: Twenty persons (14.2\%) had no acute or chronic brain abnormalities. The most common chronic neuropathologic diagnoses were AD (n = 80), cerebral infarctions (n = 52), and PD/LBD (n = 24). In persons with dementia (n = 50), 38.0\% (n = 19) had AD and infarcts, 30.0\% (n = 15) had pure AD, and 12\% each had vascular dementia (n = 6) and AD with PD/LBD (n = 6). In those without dementia (n = 91), 28.6\% (n = 26) had no chronic diagnostic abnormalities, 24.2\% (n = 22) had pure AD, and 17.6\% (n = 16) had infarctions. In persons with dementia, over 50\% had multiple diagnoses (AD, PD/LBD, or infarcts), whereas, in persons without dementia, over 80\% had one or no diagnosis. After accounting for age, persons with multiple diagnoses were almost three times (OR = 2.8; 95\% CI = 1.2, 6.7) more likely to exhibit dementia compared to those with one pathologic diagnosis. Conclusion: The majority of community-dwelling older persons have brain pathology. Those with dementia most often have multiple brain pathologies, which greatly increases the odds of dementia.}

Methods Participants included 148 autopsied subjects of the Rush Memory and Aging Project (mean age, 88.0 years), a longitudinal clinicopathological study. Cognition was assessed yearly with 21 neuropsychological tests. Infarcts were visualized on coronal slabs, and plaques and neurofibrillary tangles were counted and standardized to form a composite measure of AD pathology. Multiple regression analyses were used controlling for age, sex, and education. Results Fifty-three (35.8\%) subjects had cerebral infarcts. After accounting for AD pathology, infarcts increased the odds of dementia by 5.1-fold (95\% confidence interval, 1.98?12.92) and lowered cognitive function by 0.50 standard unit (p = 0.001). After controlling for cortical infarcts and AD pathology, subcortical infarcts, present in 39 of 53 (73.6\%) subjects with infarcts, increased the odds of dementia by almost 4-fold and reduced cognitive function by more than a third of a unit (parameter estimate = ?0.37; p = 0.03). In analyses with cognitive abilities, subcortical infarcts were associated with lower episodic, semantic, and working memory (p {$\leq$} 0.05), and had an interaction with AD pathology to further worsen working memory (p = 0.02). Interpretation Subcortical infarcts add to deleterious effects of AD pathology by increasing the odds of dementia and lowering memory function. Ann Neurol 2007}

Hippocampal atrophy is associated with declarative memory deficits and can also be associated with changes of adjacent medial temporal substructures such as the parahippocampal gyrus or the the entorhinal cortex. Similar findings are present in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) albeit to a lesser extent. While these finding facilitate the diagnostic process in patients with clinical suspicious AD, the metric properties of hippocampal atrophy for delineating healthy aging from MCI and mild AD still appear to be rather limited; as such it is not sufficient to establish the diagnosis of AD (and even more so of MCI). This limitation partly refers to methodological issues and partly to the fact that hippocampal tissue integrity is subject to various pathogenetic influences other than AD. Moreover,the effects of hippocampal atrophy on the behavioral level (e.g. cognitive deficits) are modulated by the individual{\textasciiacute}s cognitive reserve. From a clinical standpoint these observations are in line with the hypothesis that the onset and course of AD is influenced by a number of peristatic factors which are partly conceptualized in the concepts of brain and/or cognitive reserve. These complex interactions have to be considered when using the presence of hippocampal atrophy in the routine diagnostic procedure of AD.},

In a longitudinal DTI study of 203 adults between 20 and 84 years of age, we used tract-based spatial statistics to characterize the pattern of annual change in fractional anisotropy, axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity and examined whether there was an acceleration of change with age. We found extensive and overlapping significant annual decreases in fractional anisotropy, and increases in axial diffusivity, radial diffusivity, and mean diffusivity. Spatially, results were consistent with inferior-to-superior gradients of lesser-to-greater vulnerability. Annual change increased with age, particularly within superior regions, with age-related decline estimated to begin in the fifth decade. Charting white matter microstructural changes in healthy aging provides essential context to clinical studies, and future studies should compare age trajectories between healthy participants and at-risk populations and also explore the relationship between DTI rates of change and cognitive decline.}

In this work, gray matter abnormalities in late-life depression are examined in a systematic review and meta-analysis of magnetic resonance imaging studies. In the systematic review, 27 articles were identified that compared participants with late-life depression with comparison group participants, and 17 studies were suitable for inclusion in meta-analyses of volumes of the whole brain, orbitofrontal cortex, caudate, hippocampus, putamen, and thalamus. Volume reductions were detected in 7 of 15 comparisons of the hippocampus and a meta-analysis revealed a significant, but small, effect size. Although examined by fewer studies, meta-analyses also revealed significant volume reductions in the orbitofrontal cortex, putamen, and thalamus. A more systematic and comprehensive analysis of the global distribution of gray matter abnormalities, and an examination of subcortical abnormalities were identified as key areas for future research.},

Even non-diabetic individuals with impaired fasting plasma glucose (IFG) levels have shown increased cerebral atrophy, compared to individuals with normal glucose levels. We tested whether longitudinal rates of age-related cortical thinning were associated with fasting plasma glucose levels in a large sample (n\,=\,322) of early-old age individuals (60{\textendash}66 years) who were scanned with magnetic resonance imaging (1.5~T) on up to four occasions over 12 years. Higher plasma glucose levels (measured on up to three occasions) were associated with increased cortical thinning in individuals with T2D as well as those with IFG, with a similar trend for individuals with normal fasting glucose (NFG) levels. Across groups, a 1~mmol/l increase in plasma glucose (above 5~mmol/l in NFG and IFG and above 6.1~mmol/l in T2D) resulted in a 10{\textendash}13\% increase in annual cortical thinning. Increased cortical thinning was detected in insular cortex, as well as posterior cingulate, parahippocampus and medial orbitofrontal cortex. Our results provide support for the idea that raised plasma glucose levels, even in the normal range, are associated with accelerated age-related cortical atrophy.}

The technique analyzes ongoing low-frequency fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal. Through patterns of spatial coherence, these fluctuations can be used to identify the networks within the brain. Multiple brain networks are present simultaneously, and the relationships within and between networks are in constant dynamic flux. Resting state fMRI functional connectivity analysis is increasingly used to detect subtle brain network differences and, in the case of pathophysiology, subtle abnormalities in illnesses such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). The sequence of events leading up to dementia has been hypothesized to begin many years or decades before any clinical symptoms occur. Here we review the findings across rs-fMRI studies in the spectrum of preclinical AD to clinical AD. In addition, we discuss evidence for underlying preclinical AD mechanisms, including an important relationship between resting state functional connectivity and brain metabolism and how this results in a distinctive pattern of amyloid plaque deposition in default mode network regions.},

  abstract = {Background Studies of white matter microstructure in depression typically show alterations in individuals with depression, but they are frequently limited by small sample sizes and the absence of longitudinal measures of depressive symptoms. Depressive symptoms are dynamic, however, and understanding the neurobiology of different trajectories could have important clinical implications. Methods We examined associations between current and longitudinal measures of depressive symptoms and white matter microstructure (fractional anisotropy and mean diffusivity [MD]) in the UK Biobank Imaging Study. Depressive symptoms were assessed on two to four occasions over 5.9 to 10.7 years (n~= 18,959 individuals on at least two occasions, n~= 4444 on four occasions), from which we derived four measures of depressive symptomatology: cross-sectional measure at the time of scan and three longitudinal measures, namely trajectory and mean and intrasubject variance over time. Results Decreased white matter microstructure in the anterior thalamic radiation demonstrated significant associations across all four measures of depressive symptoms (MD: {$\beta$}s~= .020{\textendash}.029, pcorr {$<$} .030). The greatest effect sizes were seen between white matter microstructure and longitudinal progression (MD: {$\beta$}s~= .030{\textendash}.040, pcorr {$<$} .049). Cross-sectional symptom severity was particularly associated with decreased white matter integrity in association fibers and thalamic radiations (MD: {$\beta$}s~= .015{\textendash}.039, pcorr {$<$} .041). Greater mean and within-subject variance were~mainly associated with decreased white matter microstructure within projection fibers (MD: {$\beta$}s~= .019{\textendash}.029, pcorr {$<$} .044). Conclusions These findings indicate shared and differential neurobiological associations with severity, course, and intrasubject variability of depressive symptoms. This enriches our understanding of the neurobiology underlying dynamic features of the disorder.},

In this article, meta-analyses are designed to determine the extent of hippocampal atrophy in MCI and AD, and to evaluate the asymmetry pattern of the hippocampal volume in control, MCI, and AD groups. From 14 studies including 365 MCI patients and 382 controls, significant atrophy is found in both the left [Effect size (ES), 0.92; 95\% confidence interval (CI), 0.72{\textendash}1.11] and right (ES, 0.78; 95\% CI, 0.57{\textendash}0.98) hippocampus, which is lower than that in AD (ES, 1.60, 95\% CI, 1.37{\textendash}1.84, in left; ES, 1.52, 95\% CI, 1.31{\textendash}1.72, in right). Comparing with aging controls, the average volume reduction weighted by sample size is 12.9\% and 11.1\% in left and right hippocampus in MCI, and 24.2\% and 23.1\% in left and right hippocampus in AD, respectively. The findings show a bilateral hippocampal volume loss in MCI and the extent of atrophy is less than that in AD. By comparing the left and right hippocampal volume, a consistent left-less-than-right asymmetry pattern is found, but with different extents in control (ES, 0.39), MCI (ES, 0.56), and AD (ES, 0.30) group. {\copyright} 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

Background/Aims: We investigated the histopathological correlates of white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) in participants with Alzheimer's disease (AD) or cerebrovascular disease, and in aged controls. Methods: We reviewed 57 participants who had neuropathology and in whom neuroimaging was done. In addition to AD pathology, cortical microinfarcts, lacunes, and cerebral hemorrhages were assessed. Small-vessel disease included arteriolosclerosis and cerebral amyloid angiopathy. Postmortem brain tissue corresponding to regions of WMHs was investigated in 14 participants. The variables included: demyelination of the deep and periventricular white matter (WM), atrophy of the ventricular ependyma, and thickness of blood vessels. Partial Spearman's rank test and linear regression analysis, adjusted for age at the clinical evaluation and the duration to death, were performed. Results: The severity of arteriosclerosis was correlated with the volume of periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) estimated by magnetic resonance imaging. Deep white matter hyperintensity (DWMH) volume was correlated with the presence of cortical microinfarcts and cerebral hemorrhages. The severity of the breakdown of the ventricular lining was correlated with PVHs, and DWMHs correlated with the severity of deep WM demyelination. The diameter of small blood vessels was not associated with WMHs. Conclusion: WMHs are consistent with small-vessel disease and increase the tissue water content. We found no association between WMHs and the thickness of small blood vessels. {\copyright} 2014 S. Karger AG, Basel},

  abstract = {Increased white matter hyperintensity (WMH) volume is a common magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) finding in both autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease (ADAD) and late-onset Alzheimer disease (LOAD), but it remains unclear whether increased WMH along the AD continuum is reflective of AD-intrinsic processes or secondary to elevated systemic vascular risk factors.To estimate the associations of neurodegeneration and parenchymal and vessel amyloidosis with WMH accumulation and investigate whether systemic vascular risk is associated with WMH beyond these AD-intrinsic processes.This cohort study used data from 3 longitudinal cohort studies conducted in tertiary and community-based medical centers{\textemdash}the Dominantly Inherited Alzheimer Network (DIAN; February 2010 to March 2020), the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI; July 2007 to September 2021), and the Harvard Aging Brain Study (HABS; September 2010 to December 2019).The main outcomes were the independent associations of neurodegeneration (decreases in gray matter volume), parenchymal amyloidosis (assessed by amyloid positron emission tomography), and vessel amyloidosis (evidenced by cerebral microbleeds [CMBs]) with cross-sectional and longitudinal WMH.Data from 3960 MRI sessions among 1141 participants were included: 252 pathogenic variant carriers from DIAN (mean [SD] age, 38.4 [11.2] years; 137 [54\%] female), 571 older adults from ADNI (mean [SD] age, 72.8 [7.3] years; 274 [48\%] female), and 318 older adults from HABS (mean [SD] age, 72.4 [7.6] years; 194 [61\%] female). Longitudinal increases in WMH volume were greater in individuals with CMBs compared with those without (DIAN: t\,=\,3.2 [P\,=\,.001]; ADNI: t\,=\,2.7 [P\,=\,.008]), associated with longitudinal decreases in gray matter volume (DIAN: t\,=\,-3.1 [P\,=\,.002]; ADNI: t\,=\,-5.6 [P\,\&lt;\,.001]; HABS: t\,=\,-2.2 [P\,=\,.03]), greater in older individuals (DIAN: t\,=\,6.8 [P\,\&lt;\,.001]; ADNI: t\,=\,9.1 [P\,\&lt;\,.001]; HABS: t\,=\,5.4 [P\,\&lt;\,.001]), and not associated with systemic vascular risk (DIAN: t\,=\,0.7 [P\,=\,.40]; ADNI: t\,=\,0.6 [P\,=\,.50]; HABS: t\,=\,1.8 [P\,=\,.06]) in individuals with ADAD and LOAD after accounting for age, gray matter volume, CMB presence, and amyloid burden. In older adults without CMBs at baseline, greater WMH volume was associated with CMB development during longitudinal follow-up (Cox proportional hazards regression model hazard ratio, 2.63; 95\% CI, 1.72-4.03; P\,\&lt;\,.001).The findings suggest that increased WMH volume in AD is associated with neurodegeneration and parenchymal and vessel amyloidosis but not with elevated systemic vascular risk. Additionally, increased WMH volume may represent an early sign of vessel amyloidosis preceding the emergence of CMBs.},

  abstract = {A growing field of research explores links between behavioral measures and functional connectivity (FC) assessed using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. Recent studies suggest that measurement of these relationships may be corrupted by head motion artifact. Using data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP), we find that a surprising number of behavioral, demographic, and physiological measures (23 of 122), including fluid intelligence, reading ability, weight, and psychiatric diagnostic scales, correlate with head motion. We demonstrate that ``trait'' (across-subject) and ``state'' (across-day, within-subject) effects of motion on FC are remarkably similar in HCP data, suggesting that state effects of motion could potentially mimic trait correlates of behavior. Thus, head motion is a likely source of systematic errors (bias) in the measurement of FC:behavior relationships. Next, we show that data cleaning strategies reduce the influence of head motion and substantially alter previously reported FC:behavior relationship. Our results suggest that spurious relationships mediated by head motion may be widespread in studies linking FC to behavior.}

  abstract = {Although post-acute cognitive dysfunction and neuroimaging abnormalities have been reported after hospital discharge in patients recovered from COVID-19, little is known about persistent, long-term alterations in people without hospitalization. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 87 non-hospitalized recovered individuals 54 days after the laboratory confirmation of COVID-19. We performed structured interviews, neurological examination, 3T-MRI scans with diffusion tensor images (DTI) and functional resting-state images (fMRI). Also, we investigated fatigue, anxiety, depression, somnolence, language, memory, and cognitive flexibility, using validated instruments.Individuals self-reported a high frequency of headache (40\%) and memory difficulties (33\%). The quantitative analyses confirmed symptoms of fatigue (68\%), excessive somnolence (35\%), anxiety (29\%), impaired cognitive flexibility (40\%) and language impairment (33\%). There were widespread cerebral white matter alterations (mainly characterized by increased fractional anisotropy), which correlated with abnormal attention and cognitive flexibility. The resting-state fMRI networks analysis showed severely disrupted brain hyperconnectivity and loss of resting-state networks specificity.Competing Interest StatementThe authors declare they have no competing financial interests related to this study.Funding StatementThis study was funded by FAPESP-BRAINN (2013/03557-9), FAPESP (2019/11457-8), FAPESP (2019/233160), FAPESP (2020/04032-8); CAPES (Coordination of superior level staff improvement provided scholarship for Dr. Lucas Scardua Silva).Author DeclarationsI confirm all relevant ethical guidelines have been followed, and any necessary IRB and/or ethics committee approvals have been obtained.YesThe details of the IRB/oversight body that provided approval or exemption for the research described are given below:This study was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of the University of Campinas (Certificate of Ethical Appreciation Presentation - CAAE 31556920.0.0000.5404), and all subjects signed a consent form to participate.All necessary patient/participant consent has been obtained and the appropriate institutional forms have been archived.YesI understand that all clinical trials and any other prospective interventional studies must be registered with an ICMJE-approved registry, such as ClinicalTrials.gov.

Four cognitive tests (memory, reasoning, semantic, and phonemic fluency) were administered in 1997{\textendash}1999, 2002{\textendash}2004, and 2007{\textendash}2009, standardized to z scores, and averaged to yield a global score. Results: Of the participants, 31.0\% had metabolic abnormalities, 52.7\% were normal weight, 38.2\% were overweight, and 9.1\% were obese. Among the obese, the global cognitive score at baseline (p = 0.82) and decline (p = 0.19) over 10 years was similar in the metabolically normal and abnormal groups. In the metabolically normal group, the 10-year decline in the global cognitive score was similar (p for trend = 0.36) in the normal weight (-0.40; 95\% confidence interval [CI] -0.42 to -0.38), overweight (-0.42; 95\% CI -0.45 to -0.39), and obese (-0.42; 95\% CI -0.50 to -0.34) groups. However, in the metabolically abnormal group, the decline on the global score was faster among obese (-0.49; 95\% CI -0.55 to -0.42) than among normal weight individuals (-0.42; 95\% CI -0.50 to -0.34), (p = 0.03). Conclusions: In these analyses the fastest cognitive decline was observed in those with both obesity and metabolic abnormality.

Design Prospective cohort study. At study inception in 1985-8, there were 10 308 participants, representing a recruitment rate of 73\%. Setting Civil service departments in London, United Kingdom. Participants 5198 men and 2192 women, aged 45-70 at the beginning of cognitive testing in 1997-9. Main outcome measure Tests of memory, reasoning, vocabulary, and phonemic and semantic fluency, assessed three times over 10 years. Results All cognitive scores, except vocabulary, declined in all five age categories (age 45-49, 50-54, 55-59, 60-64, and 65-70 at baseline), with evidence of faster decline in older people. In men, the 10 year decline, shown as change/range of test{\texttimes}100, in reasoning was -3.6\% (95\% confidence interval -4.1\% to -3.0\%) in those aged 45-49 at baseline and -9.6\% (-10.6\% to -8.6\%) in those aged 65-70. In women, the corresponding decline was -3.6\% (-4.6\% to -2.7\%) and -7.4\% (-9.1\% to -5.7\%). Comparisons of longitudinal and cross sectional effects of age suggest that the latter overestimate decline in women because of cohort differences in education. For example, in women aged 45-49 the longitudinal analysis showed reasoning to have declined by -3.6\% (-4.5\% to -2.8\%) but the cross sectional effects suggested a decline of -11.4\% (-14.0\% to -8.9\%). Conclusions Cognitive decline is already evident in middle age (age 45-49).}

However, it is not known to what extent brain regions are continuously interacting when the brain is "at rest." In this work, we identify the major explicit activation networks by carrying out an image-based activation network analysis of thousands of separate activation maps derived from the BrainMap database of functional imaging studies, involving nearly 30,000 human subjects. Independently, we extract the major covarying networks in the resting brain, as imaged with functional magnetic resonance imaging in 36 subjects at rest. The sets of major brain networks, and their decompositions into subnetworks, show close correspondence between the independent analyses of resting and activation brain dynamics. We conclude that the full repertoire of functional networks utilized by the brain in action is continuously and dynamically "active" even when at "rest."},

  abstract = {Recent research suggests that increased adiposity is associated with poor cognitive performance, independently of associated medical conditions. The evidence regarding this relationship is examined in this review article. A relatively consistent finding across the lifespan is that obesity is associated with cognitive deficits, especially in executive function, in children, adolescents and adults. However, as illustrated by contradictory studies, the relationship between obesity and cognition is uncertain in the elderly, partly because of inaccuracy of body mass index as a measure of adiposity as body composition changes with aging. This review further discusses whether obesity is a cause or a consequence of these cognitive deficits, acknowledging the possible bidirectional relationship. The possible effects of increased adiposity on the brain are summarized. Our investigations suggest that weight gain results, at least in part, from a neurological predisposition characterized by reduced executive function, and in turn obesity itself has a compounding negative impact on the brain via mechanisms currently attributed to low-grade systemic inflammation, elevated lipids and/or insulin resistance. The possible role of cognitive remediation treatment strategies to prevent and/or treat obesity is discussed.},

Even ``at rest,'' the brain\&\#039;s different functional networks spontaneously fluctuate in their activity level; each network\&\#039;s spatial extent can therefore be mapped by finding temporal correlations between its different subregions. Current correlation-based approaches measure the average functional connectivity between regions, but this average is less meaningful for regions that are part of multiple networks; one ideally wants a network model that explicitly allows overlap, for example, allowing a region\&\#039;s activity pattern to reflect one network\&\#039;s activity some of the time, and another network\&\#039;s activity at other times. However, even those approaches that do allow overlap have often maximized mutual spatial independence, which may be suboptimal if distinct networks have significant overlap. In this work, we identify functionally distinct networks by virtue of their temporal independence, taking advantage of the additional temporal richness available via improvements in functional magnetic resonance imaging sampling rate. We identify multiple ``temporal functional modes,'' including several that subdivide the default-mode network (and the regions anticorrelated with it) into several functionally distinct, spatially overlapping, networks, each with its own pattern of correlations and anticorrelations. These functionally distinct modes of spontaneous brain activity are, in general, quite different from resting-state networks previously reported, and may have greater biological interpretability.}

  abstract = {There has been much recent interest in using magnetic resonance diffusion imaging to provide information about anatomical connectivity in the brain, by measuring the anisotropic diffusion of water in white matter tracts. One of the measures most commonly derived from diffusion data is fractional anisotropy (FA), which quantifies how strongly directional the local tract structure is. Many imaging studies are starting to use FA images in voxelwise statistical analyses, in order to localise brain changes related to development, degeneration and disease. However, optimal analysis is compromised by the use of standard registration algorithms; there has not to date been a satisfactory solution to the question of how to align FA images from multiple subjects in a way that allows for valid conclusions to be drawn from the subsequent voxelwise analysis. Furthermore, the arbitrariness of the choice of spatial smoothing extent has not yet been resolved. In this paper, we present a new method that aims to solve these issues via (a) carefully tuned non-linear registration, followed by (b) projection onto an alignment-invariant tract representation (the "mean FA skeleton"). We refer to this new approach as Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS). TBSS aims to improve the sensitivity, objectivity and interpretability of analysis of multi-subject diffusion imaging studies. We describe TBSS in detail and present example TBSS results from several diffusion imaging studies. FAU - Smith, Stephen M},

  abstract = {Summary Background Nutrition is an important modifiable risk factor in Alzheimer's disease. Previous trials of the multinutrient Fortasyn Connect showed benefits in mild Alzheimer's disease dementia. LipiDiDiet investigated the effects of Fortasyn Connect on cognition and related measures in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. Here, we report the 24-month results of the trial. Methods LipiDiDiet was a 24-month randomised, controlled, double-blind, parallel-group, multicentre trial (11 sites in Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden), with optional 12-month double-blind extensions. The trial enrolled individuals with prodromal Alzheimer's disease, defined according to the International Working Group (IWG)-1 criteria. Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to active product (125 mL once-a-day drink containing Fortasyn Connect) or control product. Randomisation was computer-generated centrally in blocks of four, stratified by site. All study personnel and participants were masked to treatment assignment. The primary endpoint was change in a neuropsychological test battery (NTB) score. Analysis was by modified intention to treat. Safety analyses included all participants who consumed at least one study product dose. This trial is registered with the Dutch Trial Register, number NTR1705. Findings Between April 20, 2009, and July 3, 2013, 311 of 382 participants screened were randomly assigned to the active group (n=153) or control group (n=158). Mean change in NTB primary endpoint was -0{$\cdot$}028 (SD 0{$\cdot$}453) in the active group and -0{$\cdot$}108 (0{$\cdot$}528) in the control group; estimated mean treatment difference was 0{$\cdot$}098 (95\% CI -0{$\cdot$}041 to 0{$\cdot$}237; p=0{$\cdot$}166). The decline in the control group was less than the prestudy estimate of -0{$\cdot$}4 during 24 months. 66 (21\%) participants dropped out of the study. Serious adverse events occurred in 34 (22\%) participants in the active group and 30 (19\%) in control group (p=0{$\cdot$}487), none of which were regarded as related to the study intervention. Interpretation The intervention had no significant effect on the NTB primary endpoint over 2 years in prodromal Alzheimer's disease. However, cognitive decline in this population was much lower than expected, rendering the primary endpoint inadequately powered. Group differences on secondary endpoints of disease progression measuring cognition and function and hippocampal atrophy were observed. Further study of nutritional approaches with larger sample sizes, longer duration, or a primary endpoint more sensitive in this pre-dementia population, is needed.

The SHEP was a randomized multicenter double-blind outpatient clinical trial of the impact of treating ISH in men and women aged 60 years and older.Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, with DBP and systolic blood pressure (SBP) as time-dependent covariables.After adjustment for the baseline risk factors of race (black vs other), sex, use of antihypertensive medication before the study, a composite variable (diabetes, previous heart attack, or stroke), age, and smoking history (ever vs never) and adjustment for the SBP as a time-dependent variable, we found, for the active treatment group only, that a decrease of 5 mm Hg in DBP increased the risk for stroke (relative risk, [RR], 1.14; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 1.05-1.22), for CHD (RR, 1.08; 95\% CI, 1.00-1.16), and for CVD (RR, 1.11; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.16).Some patients with ISH may be treated to a level that uncovers subclinical disease, and some may be overtreated. Further studies need to determine whether excessively low DBP can be prevented by more careful titration of antihypertensive therapy while maintaining SBP control. It is reassuring that patients receiving treatment for ISH never perform worse than patients receiving placebo in terms of CVD events.Arch Intern Med. 1999;159:2004-2009--{$>$}},

However, both approaches do not involve covariates other than the biomarker and cannot be used to estimate the ROC curve adjusted for covariates. To account for the covariate effect, we propose a joint model approach which assumes that the hazard of failure depends on the biomarker and the covariates through a proportional hazards model and that the biomarker depends the covariates through a semiparametric location model. We propose semiparametric estimators for covariate-specific ROC curves corresponding to the two time-dependent ROC curve definitions, respectively. We show that the estimators are consistent and converge to Gaussian processes. In the case of no covariates, the estimators are demonstrated to be more efficient than the Heagerty-Lumley-Pepe estimator and the Heagerty-Zheng estimator via simulation studies. In addition, the estimators can be easily extended to other survival models. We apply these estimators to an HIV dataset.}

Cross-sectional results indicate that reduced GMV may be associated with excess body weight. METHODS: Demographic, biometric, and behavioral measures were obtained from 48 women as part of the Pittsburgh Healthy Women Study, a longitudinal epidemiological investigation initiated between 1983 and 1984. In 2005 and 2006, these women took part in a brain imaging protocol. RESULTS: Premenopausal BMI and a priori chosen confounding variables, including the number of years post menopause, an aggregate measure of perceived life stress spanning a 20-year period, resting blood pressure, total cerebral volume, and severity of white matter hyperintensities (a suspected indicator of aging-related silent cerebrovascular disease), explained approximately 22\% of variance in total GMV. An additional 15\% of the variance was uniquely explained by the change in BMI between pre- and postmenopausal longitudinal assessments, such that an increase in BMI predicted a greater reduction in GMV. CONCLUSIONS: An increase in BMI during the menopausal transition and beyond is associated with reduced GMV among otherwise healthy women.},

In the present work, the identification of cerebral metabolic patterns with significant prognostic value for conversion of MCI patients to AD is investigated with voxel-based Cox regression, which in contrast to common categorical comparisons also utilizes time information. Methods FDG PET data of 544 MCI patients from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database were randomly split into two equally-sized datasets (training and test). Within a median follow-up duration of 47\,months (95\% CI: 46{\textendash}48\,months) 181 patients developed AD. In the training dataset, voxel-wise Cox regressions were used to identify regions associated with conversion of MCI to AD. These were compared to regions identified by a classical group comparison (analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with statistical parametric mapping (SPM) 8) between converters and non-converters (both adjusted for apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, mini-mental state examination (MMSE) score, age, sex and education). In the test dataset, normalized FDG uptake within significant brain regions from voxel-wise Cox- and ANCOVA analyses (Cox- and ANCOVA- regions of interest (ROI), respectively) and clinical variables APOE status, MMSE score and education were tested in different Cox models (adjusted for age, sex) including: (1) only clinical variables, (2) only normalized FDG uptake in ANCOVA-ROI, (3) only normalized FDG uptake from Cox-ROI, (4) clinical variables plus FDG uptake in ANCOVA-ROI, (5) clinical variables plus FDG uptake from Cox-ROI. Results Conversion-related regions with relative hypometabolism comprised parts of the temporo-parietal and posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus for voxel-wise ANCOVA, plus frontal regions for voxel-wise Cox regression (both p\,{$<$}\,.01, false discovery rate (FDR) corrected). The clinical-only model (1) and the models based on normalized FDG uptake from Cox-ROI only (2) and ANCOVA-ROI only (3) all significantly predicted conversion to AD (Wald Test (WT): p\,{$<$}\,.001). The clinical model (1) was significantly improved by adding imaging information in model (4) (Akaike information criterion (AIC) relative likelihood (RL) (1) vs (4): RL\,{$<$}\,0.018). There were no significant differences between models (2) and (3), as well as (4) and (5). Conclusions Voxel-wise Cox regression identifies conversion-related patterns of cerebral glucose metabolism, but is not superior to classical group contrasts in this regard. With imaging information from both FDG PET patterns, the prediction of conversion to AD was improved.},

  abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder that prominently affects cerebral connectivity. Assessing the functional connectivity at rest, recent functional MRI (fMRI) studies reported on the existence of resting-state networks (RSNs). RSNs are characterized by spatially coherent, spontaneous fluctuations in the blood oxygen level-dependent signal and are made up of regional patterns commonly involved in functions such as sensory, attention, or default mode processing. In AD, the default mode network (DMN) is affected by reduced functional connectivity and atrophy. In this work, we analyzed functional and structural MRI data from healthy elderly (n = 16) and patients with amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) (n = 24), a syndrome of high risk for developing AD. Two questions were addressed: (i) Are any RSNs altered in aMCI? (ii) Do changes in functional connectivity relate to possible structural changes? Independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI data identified eight spatially consistent RSNs. Only selected areas of the DMN and the executive attention network demonstrated reduced network-related activity in the patient group. Voxel-based morphometry revealed atrophy in both medial temporal lobes (MTL) of the patients. The functional connectivity between both hippocampi in the MTLs and the posterior cingulate of the DMN was present in healthy controls but absent in patients. We conclude that in individuals at risk for AD, a specific subset of RSNs is altered, likely representing effects of ongoing early neurodegeneration. We interpret our finding as a proof of principle, demonstrating that functional brain disorders can be characterized by functional-disconnectivity profiles of RSNs.},

Age effects were inverted in the left posterior temporal region, where GMD gain continued up to age 30 and then rapidly declined. The trajectory of maturational and aging effects varied considerably over the cortex. Visual, auditory and limbic cortices, which are known to myelinate early, showed a more linear pattern of aging than the frontal and parietal neocortices, which continue myelination into adulthood. Our findings also indicate that the posterior temporal cortices, primarily in the left hemisphere, which typically support language functions, have a more protracted course of maturation than any other cortical region.},

  abstract = {Obesity is a chronic metabolic disorder that may also lead to reduced white matter integrity, potentially due to shared genetic risk factors. Genetic correlation analyses were conducted in a large cohort of Mexican American families in San Antonio (N = 761, 58\% females, ages 18{\textendash}81 years; 41.3 {$\pm$} 14.5) from the Genetics of Brain Structure and Function Study. Shared genetic variance was calculated between measures of adiposity [(body mass index (BMI; kg/m\textsuperscript{2}) and waist circumference (WC; in)] and whole-brain and regional measurements of cerebral white matter integrity (fractional anisotropy). Whole-brain average and regional fractional anisotropy values for 10 major white matter tracts were calculated from high angular resolution diffusion tensor imaging data (DTI; 1.7 {\texttimes} 1.7 {\texttimes} 3 mm; 55 directions). Additive genetic factors explained intersubject variance in BMI (heritability, h\textsuperscript{2} = 0.58), WC (h\textsuperscript{2} = 0.57), and FA (h\textsuperscript{2} = 0.49). FA shared significant portions of genetic variance with BMI in the genu ({$\rho$}G = -0.25), body ({$\rho$}G = -0.30), and splenium ({$\rho$}G = -0.26) of the corpus callosum, internal capsule ({$\rho$}G = -0.29), and thalamic radiation ({$\rho$}G = -0.31) (all p's = 0.043). The strongest evidence of shared variance was between BMI/WC and FA in the superior fronto-occipital fasciculus ({$\rho$}G = -0.39, p = 0.020; {$\rho$}G = -0.39, p = 0.030), which highlights region-specific variation in neural correlates of obesity. This may suggest that increase in obesity and reduced white matter integrity share common genetic risk factors.}

Obesity could promote these diseases through several different mechanisms. Here we review evidence supporting the involvement of two recently recognized factors linking obesity with neurodegeneration: the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines and onset of insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) resistance. Excess peripheral pro-inflammatory mediators, some of which can cross the blood brain barrier, may trigger neuroinflammation, which subsequently exacerbates neurodegeneration. Insulin and IGF-1 resistance leads to weakening of neuroprotective signaling by these molecules and can contribute to onset of neurodegenerative diseases.},

There is an urgent need for methods that can overcome these challenges to model this complex data. At present there is no cure for dementia and no treatment that can successfully change the course of the disease. Machine learning models that can predict the time until a patient develops dementia are important tools in helping understand dementia risks and can give more accurate results than traditional statistical methods when modelling high-dimensional, heterogeneous, clinical data. This work compares the performance and stability of ten machine learning algorithms, combined with eight feature selection methods, capable of performing survival analysis of high-dimensional, heterogeneous, clinical data. We developed models that predict survival to dementia using baseline data from two different studies. The Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS) is a longitudinal cohort study of 1037 participants, aged 70{\textendash}90~years, that aims to determine the effects of ageing on cognition. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) is a longitudinal study aimed at identifying biomarkers for the early detection and tracking of Alzheimer's disease. Using the concordance index as a measure of performance, our models achieve maximum performance values of 0.82 for MAS and 0.93 For ADNI.}

We therefore examined prospectively the effects of the central inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1{$\beta$}, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor-{$\alpha$} (TNF-{$\alpha$}) on the development of type 2 diabetes. We designed a nested case-control study within the prospective population-based European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition (EPIC)-Potsdam study including 27,548 individuals. Case subjects were defined to be those who were free of type 2 diabetes at baseline and subsequently developed type 2 diabetes during a 2.3-year follow-up period. A total of 192 cases of incident type 2 diabetes were identified and matched with 384 non-disease-developing control subjects. IL-6 and TNF-{$\alpha$} levels were found to be elevated in participants with incident type 2 diabetes, whereas IL-1{$\beta$} plasma levels did not differ between the groups. Analysis of single cytokines revealed IL-6 as an independent predictor of type 2 diabetes after adjustment for age, sex, BMI, waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), sports, smoking status, educational attainment, alcohol consumption, and HbA1c (4th vs. the 1st quartile: odds ratio [OR] 2.6, 95\% CI 1.2{\textendash}5.5). The association between TNF-{$\alpha$} and future type 2 diabetes was no longer significant after adjustment for BMI or WHR. Interestingly, combined analysis of the cytokines revealed a significant interaction between IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-6. In the fully adjusted model, participants with detectable levels of IL-1{$\beta$} and elevated levels of IL-6 had an independently increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes (3.3, 1.7{\textendash}6.8), whereas individuals with increased concentrations of IL-6 but undetectable levels of IL-1{$\beta$} had no significantly increased risk, both compared with the low-level reference group. These results were confirmed in an analysis including only individuals with HbA1c \&amp;lt;5.8\% at baseline. Our data suggest that the pattern of circulating inflammatory cytokines modifies the risk for type 2 diabetes. In particular, a combined elevation of IL-1{$\beta$} and IL-6, rather than the isolated elevation of IL-6 alone, independently increases the risk of type 2 diabetes. These data strongly support the hypothesis that a subclinical inflammatory reaction has a role in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The most appropriate targets for systolic blood pressure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among persons without diabetes remain uncertain. METHODS: We randomly assigned 9361 persons with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes. RESULTS: At 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65\% per year vs. 2.19\% per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95\% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P{$<$}0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P=0.003). Rates of serious adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

We explore this relationship in a large cohort of otherwise healthy subjects. The present study classified 103 adult participants from the Brain Resource International Database between 21 and 86 years of age without history of neurological, medical, or psychiatric illness according to BMI (normal weight, overweight, obese) and subjected them to diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). Resulting fractional anisotropy (FA) indexes for the corpus callosum and fornix were examined in relation to BMI and age in a multiple regression framework. Results indicated that increasing BMI was independently associated with lower FA in the genu, splenium, and fornix, and a BMI x age interaction emerged for FA in the splenium and body of the corpus callosum. When categorized, obese persons demonstrated lower FA than normal and overweight persons for all WM indexes, but no FA differences emerged between overweight and normal persons. Results indicate both a direct association between obesity and reduced WM tract integrity and an interaction between obesity and aging processes on certain WM tracts in otherwise healthy adults. While such findings suggest a possible role for adiposity in WM dysfunction and associated cognitive deficits, prospective studies are needed to clarify the nature of these relationships and elucidate underlying mechanisms.

  abstract = {Accurate memory for discrete events is thought to rely on pattern separation to orthogonalize the representations of similar events. Previously, we reported that a behavioral index of pattern separation was correlated with activity in the hippocampus (dentate gyrus, CA3) and with integrity of the perforant path, which provides input to the hippocampus. If the hippocampus operates as part of a broader neural network, however, pattern separation would likely also relate to integrity of limbic tracts (fornix, cingulum bundle, and uncinate fasciculus) that connect the hippocampus to distributed brain regions. In this study, healthy adults (20{\textendash}89 years) underwent diffusion tensor imaging and completed the Behavioral Pattern Separation Task-Object Version (BPS-O) and Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). After controlling for global effects of brain aging, exploratory skeleton-wise and targeted tractography analyses revealed that fornix integrity (fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and radial diffusivity; but not mode) was significantly related to pattern separation (measured using BPS-O and RAVLT tasks), but not to recognition memory. These data suggest that hippocampal disconnection, via individual- and age-related differences in limbic tract integrity, contributes to pattern separation performance. Extending our earlier work, these results also support the notion that pattern separation relies on broad neural networks interconnecting the hippocampus.}

N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of NO synthase, was administered directly into the femoral artery of normal subjects at a dose of 16 mg/min and leg blood flow (LBF) was measured during an infusion of saline (NS) or during a euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp (HIC) designed to approximately double LBF. In response to the intrafemoral artery infusion of L-NMMA, LBF decreased from 0.296 +/- 0.032 to 0.235 +/- 0.022 liters/min during NS and from 0.479 +/- 0.118 to 0.266 +/- 0.052 liters/min during HIC, P {$<$} 0.03. The proportion of NO-dependent LBF during NS and HIC was approximately 20\% and approximately 40\%, respectively, P {$<$} 0.003 (NS vs. HIC). To elucidate whether insulin increases EDNO synthesis/release or EDNO action, vasodilative responses to graded intrafemoral artery infusions of the endothelium-dependent vasodilator methacholine chloride (MCh) or the endothelium-independent vasodilator sodium nitroprusside (SNP) were studied in normal subjects during either NS or HIC. LBF increments in response to intrafemoral artery infusions of MCh but not SNP were augmented during HIC versus NS, P {$<$} 0.03. In summary, insulin-mediated vasodilation is EDNO dependent. Insulin vasodilation of skeletal muscle vasculature most likely occurs via increasing EDNO synthesis/release. Thus, insulin appears to be a novel modulator of the EDNO system.}

The conventional risk model incorporated age, sex, education, cognition, physical function, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol use), health (cardiovascular disease, diabetes, systolic blood pressure), and the apolipoprotein genotype (C statistic for discrimination performance was 0.77, 95\% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.82). No significant differences were observed in the discrimination performance of the conventional risk model compared with models incorporating data from MRI including white matter lesion volume (C statistic 0.77, 95\% confidence interval 0.72 to 0.82; P=0.48 for difference of C statistics), brain volume (0.77, 0.72 to 0.82; P=0.60), hippocampal volume (0.79, 0.74 to 0.84; P=0.07), or all three variables combined (0.79, 0.75 to 0.84; P=0.05). Inclusion of hippocampal volume or all three MRI variables combined in the conventional model did, however, lead to significant improvement in reclassification measured by using the integrated discrimination improvement index (P=0.03 and P=0.04) and showed increased net benefit in decision curve analysis. Similar results were observed when the outcome was restricted to Alzheimer's disease.Conclusions Data from MRI do not significantly improve discrimination performance in prediction of all cause dementia beyond a model incorporating demographic, cognitive, health, lifestyle, physical function, and genetic data. There were, however, statistical improvements in reclassification, prognostic separation, and some evidence of clinical utility.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Finnish Geriatric Intervention Study to Prevent Cognitive Impairment and Disability (FINGER) was a multicenter randomized controlled trial that reported beneficial effects on cognition for a 2-year multimodal intervention (diet, exercise, cognitive training, vascular risk monitoring) versus control (general health advice). This study reports exploratory analyses of brain MRI measures. METHODS: FINGER targeted 1260 older individuals from the general Finnish population. Participants were 60-77\,years old, at increased risk for dementia but without dementia/substantial cognitive impairment. Brain MRI scans were available for 132 participants (68 intervention, 64 control) at baseline and 112 participants (59 intervention, 53 control) at 2\,years. MRI measures included regional brain volumes, cortical thickness, and white matter lesion (WML) volume. Cognition was assessed at baseline and 1- and 2-year visits using a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. We investigated the (1) differences between the intervention and control groups in change in MRI outcomes (FreeSurfer 5.3) and (2) post hoc sub-group analyses of intervention effects on cognition in participants with more versus less pronounced structural brain changes at baseline (mixed-effects regression models, Stata 12). RESULTS: No significant differences between the intervention and control groups were found on the changes in MRI measures. Beneficial intervention effects on processing speed were more pronounced in individuals with higher baseline cortical thickness in Alzheimer's disease signature areas (composite measure of entorhinal, inferior and middle temporal, and fusiform regions). The randomization group\,{\texttimes}\,time\,{\texttimes}\,cortical thickness interaction coefficient was 0.198 (p\,=\,0.021). A similar trend was observed for higher hippocampal volume (group\,{\texttimes}\,time\,{\texttimes}\,hippocampus volume interaction coefficient 0.1149, p\,=\,0.085). CONCLUSIONS: The FINGER MRI exploratory sub-study did not show significant differences between the intervention and control groups on changes in regional brain volumes, regional cortical thicknesses, or WML volume after 2\,years in at-risk elderly without substantial impairment. The cognitive benefits on processing speed of the FINGER intervention may be more pronounced in individuals with fewer structural brain changes on MRI at baseline. This suggests that preventive strategies may be more effective if started early, before the occurrence of more pronounced structural brain changes.

  abstract = {Summary The concept of cognitive reserve provides an explanation for differences between individuals in susceptibility to age-related brain changes or pathology related to Alzheimer's disease, whereby some people can tolerate more of these changes than others and maintain function. Epidemiological studies suggest that lifelong experiences, including educational and occupational attainment, and leisure activities in later life, can increase this reserve. For example, the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease is reduced in individuals with higher educational or occupational attainment. Reserve can conveniently be divided into two types: brain reserve, which refers to differences in the brain structure that may increase tolerance to pathology, and cognitive reserve, which refers to differences between individuals in how tasks are performed that might enable some people to be more resilient to brain changes than others. Greater understanding of the concept of cognitive reserve could lead to interventions to slow cognitive ageing or reduce the risk of dementia.}

Eighty-seven mild cognitive impairment (MCIs) subjects and 135 matched controls (HCs) were employed at baseline, and they underwent functional MRI scans, clinical evaluations and exon sequencings of 20 genes related to brain insulin resistance. A longitudinal study for an average of 35months was performed to assess their cognitive decline over time. By using cognition as the phenotype, we detected genes that modified cognitive impairments, including AKT2, PIK3CB, IGF1R, PIK3CD, MTOR, IDE, AKT1S1 and AKT1. Based on these loci, the mass univariate modeling was utilized to construct the functional network. The MCIs showed disconnections mainly in the cerebellum-frontal-temporal regions, while compensations may occur in frontal-parietal regions to maintain the overall network efficiency. Moreover, the behavioral significance of the network was highlighted, as topological characteristics of the medial temporal lobe and the prefrontal cortex partially determine longitudinal cognitive decline. Our results suggested that the restoration of insulin activity represents a promising therapeutic target for alleviating cognitive decline associated with T2D and AD.},

Yet, it is unknown how CMRs interact with sex and apolipoprotein E-?4 (APOE4), a known genetic risk factor for AD, to influence brain age across different life stages. Using age prediction based on multi-shell diffusion-weighted imaging data in 21,308 UK Biobank participants, we investigated whether associations between white matter Brain Age Gap (BAG) and body mass index (BMI), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), body fat percentage (BF\%), and APOE4 status varied (i) between males and females, (ii) according to age at menopause in females, and (iii) across different age groups in males and females. We report sex differences in associations between BAG and all three CMRs, with stronger positive associations among males compared to females. Independent of APOE4 status, higher BAG (older brain age relative to chronological age) was associated with greater BMI, WHR, and BF\% in males, whereas in females, higher BAG was associated with greater WHR, but not BMI and BF\%. These divergent associations were most prominent within the oldest group of females (66?81?years), where greater BF\% was linked to lower BAG. Earlier menopause transition was associated with higher BAG, but no interactions were found with CMRs. In conclusion, the findings point to sex- and age-specific associations between CMRs and brain age. Incorporating sex as a factor of interest in studies addressing CMR may promote sex-specific precision medicine, consequently improving health care for both males and females.},

All subjects were interviewed and examined and had measurements of waist-to-hip ratio (WHR). Odds ratios (ORs) of ischemic stroke were calculated with gender-specific quartiles (GQs) and gender-specific medians of WHR adjusted for stroke risk factors and body mass index (BMI). Results{\textemdash} Compared with the first quartile, the third and fourth quartiles of WHR had an increased risk of stroke (GQ3: OR, 2.4; 95\% CI, 1.5 to 3.9; GQ4: OR, 3.0; 95\% CI, 1.8 to 4.8) adjusted for other risk factors and BMI. Those with WHR equal to or greater than the median had an overall OR of 3.0 (95\% CI, 2.1 to 4.2) for ischemic stroke even after adjustment for other risk factors and BMI. Increased WHR was associated with a greater risk of stroke in men and women and in all race-ethnic groups. The effect of WHR was stronger among younger persons (test for heterogeneity, P\&amp;lt;0.0002) (\&amp;lt;65 years of age: OR, 4.4; 95\%CI, 2.2 to 9.0; {$\geq$}65 years of age: OR, 2.2; 95\% CI, 1.4 to 3.2). WHR was associated with an increased risk among those with and without large-artery atherosclerotic stroke. Conclusions{\textemdash} Abdominal obesity is an independent, potent risk factor for ischemic stroke in all race-ethnic groups. It is a stronger risk factor than BMI and has a greater effect among younger persons. Prevention of obesity and weight reduction need greater emphasis in stroke prevention programs.}

Methods For assessment of white matter microstructure, we used measures derived from neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) including the intracellular volume fraction (an estimate of neurite density) and isotropic volume fraction (an index of the relative extra-cellular water diffusion). To estimate differences associated specifically with blood pressure, we applied propensity score matching based on age, sex, educational level, body mass index, and history of smoking, diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease to perform separate contrasts of non-hypertensive (normotensive or pre-hypertensive, N = 2332) and hypertensive (N = 2337) individuals and of normotensive (N = 741) and pre-hypertensive (N = 1581) individuals (p{$<$}0.05 after Bonferroni correction). Results The brain white matter intracellular volume fraction was significantly lower, and isotropic volume fraction was higher in hypertensive relative to non-hypertensive individuals (N = 1559, each). The white matter isotropic volume fraction also was higher in pre-hypertensive than in normotensive individuals (N = 694, each) in the right superior longitudinal fasciculus and the right superior thalamic radiation, where the lower intracellular volume fraction was observed in the hypertensives relative to the non-hypertensive group. Significance Pathological processes associated with chronically elevated blood pressure are associated with imaging differences suggesting chronic alterations of white matter axonal structure that may affect cognitive functions even with pre-hypertension.}

Oxidative stress may instigate or accelerate the development of vascular disease, and oxidative stress markers are elevated in AD. Here, we assess independent relationships between three serum lipid peroxidation markers (lipid hydroperoxides [LPH], 8-isoprostane, and 4-hydroxynonenal) and the presence of extensive subcortical WMH and/or AD. Patients were recruited from memory and stroke prevention clinics into four groups: minimal WMH, extensive WMH, AD with minimal WMH, and AD with extensive WMH. Extensive WMH, but not AD, was associated with higher serum concentrations of 8-isoprostane and LPH. Peripheral LPH concentrations mediated the effect of hypertension on deep, but not periventricular, WMH volumes. 4-hydroxynonenal was associated with hyperlipidemia and cerebral microbleeds, but not with extensive WMH or AD. We conclude that lipid peroxidation mediates hypertensive injury to the deep subcortical white matter and that peripheral blood lipid peroxidation markers indicate subcortical small vessel disease regardless of an AD diagnosis.},

Methods and Procedures: We collected brain MR images from 690 men and 738 women, and their height, weight, and other clinical information. The collected images were automatically normalized into a common standard space for an objective assessment of neuroanatomical correlations in volumetric analysis and VBM with BMI. Results: Volumetric analysis revealed a significant negative correlation in men (P {$<$} 0.001, adjusting for age, lifetime alcohol intake, history of hypertension, and diabetes mellitus), although not in women, between BMI and the gray matter ratio, which represents the percentage of gray matter volume in the intracranial volume. VBM revealed that, in men, the regional gray matter volume of the bilateral medial temporal lobes, anterior lobe of the cerebellum, occipital lobe, frontal lobe, precuneus, and midbrain showed significant negative correlations with BMI, while those of the bilateral inferior frontal gyri, posterior lobe of the cerebellum, frontal lobes, temporal lobes, thalami, and caudate heads showed significant positive correlations with BMI. Discussion: Global loss and regional alterations in gray matter volume occur in obese male subjects, suggesting that male subjects with a high BMI are at greater risk for future declines in cognition or other brain functions.}

  abstract = {RATIONALE: The default mode network (DMN), one of several resting-state networks (RSN) in the brain, is thought to be involved in self-referential thought, awareness, and episodic memories. Nicotine improves cognitive performance, in part by improving attention. Nicotinic agonists have been shown to decrease activity in regions within DMN and increase activity in regions involved in visual attention during effortful processing of external stimuli. It is unknown if these pharmacological effects also occur in the absence of effortful processing. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to determine if nicotine suppresses activity in default mode and enhances activity in extra-striate RSNs in the absence of an external visual task. METHODS: Within-subject, single-blinded, counterbalanced study of 19 non-smoking subjects who had resting functional MRI scans after 7 mg nicotine or placebo patch. Group independent component analysis was performed. The DMN component was identified by spatial correlation with a reference DMN mask. A visual attention component was identified by spatial correlation with an extra-striate mask. Analyses were conducted using statistical parametric mapping. RESULTS: Nicotine was associated with decreased activity in regions within the DMN and increased activity in extra-striate regions. CONCLUSIONS: Suppression of DMN and enhancement of extra-striate resting-state activity in the absence of visual stimuli or effortful processing suggest that nicotine's cognitive effects may involve a shift in activity from networks that process internal to those that process external information. This is a potential mechanism by which cholinergic agonists may have a beneficial effect in diseases associated with altered resting-state activity.},

Numerous models have been developed for predicting dementia. To evaluate these models we undertook a systematic review in 2010 and updated this in 2014 due to the increase in research published in this area. Here we include a critique of the variables selected for inclusion and an assessment of model prognostic performance. Methods Our previous systematic review was updated with a search from January 2009 to March 2014 in electronic databases (MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science). Articles examining risk of dementia in non-demented individuals and including measures of sensitivity, specificity or the area under the curve (AUC) or c-statistic were included. Findings In total, 1,234 articles were identified from the search; 21 articles met inclusion criteria. New developments in dementia risk prediction include the testing of non-APOE genes, use of non-traditional dementia risk factors, incorporation of diet, physical function and ethnicity, and model development in specific subgroups of the population including individuals with diabetes and those with different educational levels. Four models have been externally validated. Three studies considered time or cost implications of computing the model. Interpretation There is no one model that is recommended for dementia risk prediction in population-based settings. Further, it is unlikely that one model will fit all. Consideration of the optimal features of new models should focus on methodology (setting/sample, model development and testing in a replication cohort) and the acceptability and cost of attaining the risk variables included in the prediction score. Further work is required to validate existing models or develop new ones in different populations as well as determine the ethical implications of dementia risk prediction, before applying the particular models in population or clinical settings.}

In this analysis, we evaluated scans and brain samples from 123 subjects (86\% women) with a mean age of 90.6 years. We found CAA to be present in 63\% of the 123 subjects, whereas WMH was present in 74\%, and dementia in 59\%. The presence of WMH of any severity did not relate to the presence or the degree of CAA severity, irrespective of the dementia status of the subjects. Furthermore, multivariate regression analysis showed a clear association between CAA and dementia but WMH was not related to dementia in this very old sample. We conclude that severe WMH may not be determined by CAA in this very elderly population.},

  abstract = {Purpose White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are prevalent among older adults and are often associated with cognitive decline and increased risk of stroke and dementia. Vascular risk factors (VRFs) are linked to WMH, yet the impact of multiple VRFs on gray matter function is still unclear. The goal of this study was to test for associations between the number of VRFs and cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) and resting state (RS) coactivation among individuals with WMH. Materials and Methods Twenty-nine participants with suspected WMH were grouped based on the number of VRFs (subgroups: 0, 1, or {$\geq$}2). CVR and RS coactivation were measured with blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) imaging on a 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system during hypercapnia and rest, respectively. Default-mode (DMN), sensory-motor, and medial-visual networks, generated using independent component analysis of RS-BOLD, were selected as networks of interest (NOIs). CVR-BOLD was analyzed using two methods: 1) a model-based approach using CO2 traces, and 2) a dual-regression (DR) approach using NOIs as spatial inputs. Average CVR and RS coactivations within NOIs were compared between VRF subgroups. A secondary analysis investigated the correlation between CVR and RS coactivation. Results VRF subgroup differences were detected using DR-based CVR in the DMN (F20,2?=?5.17, P?=?0.015) but not the model-based CVR nor RS coactivation. DR-based CVR was correlated with RS coactivation in the DMN (r2?=?0.28, P?=?0.006) but not the sensory-motor nor medial-visual NOIs. Conclusion In individuals with WMH, CVR in the DMN was inversely associated with the number of VRFs and correlated with RS coactivation. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;42:1369?1376.},

  abstract = {Selecting a set of relevant markers to predict conversion from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) has become a challenging task given the wealth of regional pathologic information that can be extracted from multimodal imaging data. Here, we used regularized regression approaches with an elastic net penalty for best subset selection of multiregional information from AV45-PET, FDG-PET and volumetric MRI data to predict conversion from MCI to AD. The study sample consisted of 127 MCI subjects from ADNI-2 who had a clinical follow-up between 6 and 31~months. Additional analyses assessed the effect of partial volume correction on predictive performance of AV45- and FDG-PET data. Predictor variables were highly collinear within and across imaging modalities. Penalized Cox regression yielded more parsimonious prediction models compared to unpenalized Cox regression. Within single modalities, time to conversion was best predicted by increased AV45-PET signal in posterior medial and lateral cortical regions, decreased FDG-PET signal in medial temporal and temporobasal regions, and reduced gray matter volume in medial, basal, and lateral temporal regions. Logistic regression models reached up to 72\% cross-validated accuracy for prediction of conversion status, which was comparable to cross-validated accuracy of non-linear support vector machine classification. Regularized regression outperformed unpenalized stepwise regression when number of parameters approached or exceeded the number of training cases. Partial volume correction had a negative effect on the predictive performance of AV45-PET, but slightly improved the predictive value of FDG-PET data. Penalized regression yielded more parsimonious models than unpenalized stepwise regression for the integration of multiregional and multimodal imaging information. The advantage of penalized regression was particularly strong with a high number of collinear predictors.}

We examined in a monozygotic twin sample whether the association between vascular risk and WMHs is influenced by overlapping genetic factors. We included 195 cognitively normal monozygotic twins (age~= 70 {$\pm$} 7 years), including 94 complete pairs. Regional WMH load was estimated using an automated algorithm. Vascular risk was summarized with the Framingham score. The within{\textendash}twin pair correlation for total WMHs was 0.76 and for Framingham score was 0.77. Within participants, Framingham score was associated with total and periventricular WMHs (r~= 0.32). Framingham score in 1 twin was also associated with total WMHs in the co-twin (r~= 0.26). Up to 83\% of the relation between both traits could be explained by shared genetic effects. In conclusion, monozygotic twins have highly similar vascular risk and WMH burden, confirming a genetic background for these traits. The association between both traits is largely driven by overlapping genetic factors.},

Predicting the onset of dementia is challenging even in the presence of amyloid, as time to progression varies considerably among patients and depends on the onset of neurodegeneration. Survival analysis can account for variability in time to event, but has not often been applied to MRI measurements beyond singular predefined brain regions such as the hippocampus. Here we used a voxel-wise survival analysis to identify in an unbiased fashion brain regions where decreased gray matter volume is associated with time to dementia, and assessed the effects of amyloid on these associations.}

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is commonly observed on neuroimaging among elderly individuals and is recognized as a major vascular contributor to dementia, cognitive decline, gait impairment, mood disturbance and stroke. However, clinical symptoms are often highly inconsistent in nature and severity among patients with similar degrees of SVD on brain imaging. Here, we provide a new framework based on new advances in structural and functional neuroimaging that aims to explain the remarkable clinical variation in SVD. First, we discuss the heterogeneous pathology present in SVD lesions despite an identical appearance on imaging and the perilesional and remote effects of these lesions. We review effects of SVD on structural and functional connectivity in the brain, and we discuss how network disruption by SVD can lead to clinical deficits. We address reserve and compensatory mechanisms in SVD and discuss the part played by other age-related pathologies. Finally, we conclude that SVD should be considered a global rather than a focal disease, as the classically recognized focal lesions affect remote brain structures and structural and functional network connections. The large variability in clinical symptoms among patients with SVD can probably be understood by taking into account the heterogeneity of SVD lesions, the effects of SVD beyond the focal lesions, the contribution of neurodegenerative pathologies other than SVD, and the interaction with reserve mechanisms and compensatory mechanisms.}

  abstract = {Objective To determine the contribution of acute infarcts, evidenced by diffusion-weighted imaging positive (DWI+) lesions, to progression of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and other cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) markers. Methods We performed monthly 3T magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for 10 consecutive months in 54 elderly individuals with SVD. MRI included high-resolution multishell DWI, and 3-dimensional fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, T1, and susceptibility-weighted imaging. We determined DWI+ lesion evolution, WMH progression rate (ml/mo), and number of incident lacunes and microbleeds, and calculated for each marker the proportion of progression explained by DWI+ lesions. Results We identified 39 DWI+ lesions on 21 of 472 DWI scans in 9 of 54 subjects. Of the 36 DWI+ lesions with follow-up MRI, 2 evolved into WMH, 4 evolved into a lacune (3 with cavity {$<$}3mm), 3 evolved into a microbleed, and 27 were not detectable on follow-up. WMH volume increased at a median rate of 0.027 ml/mo (interquartile range = 0.005?0.073), but was not significantly higher in subjects with DWI+ lesions compared to those without (p =?0.195). Of the 2 DWI+ lesions evolving into WMH on follow-up, one explained 23\% of the total WMH volume increase in one subject, whereas the WMH regressed in the other subject. DWI+ lesions preceded 4 of 5 incident lacunes and 3 of 10 incident microbleeds. Interpretation DWI+ lesions explain only a small proportion of the total WMH progression. Hence, WMH progression seems to be mostly driven by factors other than acute infarcts. DWI+ lesions explain the majority of incident lacunes and small cavities, and almost one-third of incident microbleeds, confirming that WMH, lacunes, and microbleeds, although heterogeneous on MRI, can have a common initial appearance on MRI.

  abstract = {Objectives: We sought to examine whether a posterior distribution of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) is an independent predictor of pathologically confirmed cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and whether it is associated with MRI markers of CAA, in patients without lobar intracerebral hemorrhage. Methods: We developed a quantitative method to measure anteroposterior (AP) distribution of WMH. A retrospective cohort of patients without intracerebral hemorrhage and with pathologic evaluation of CAA was examined to determine whether posterior WMH distribution was an independent predictor of CAA (n = 59). The relationship of AP distributions of WMH to strictly lobar microbleeds (MBs) (n = 259) and location of dilated perivascular spaces (DPVS) (n = 85) was examined in a separate cohort of patients evaluated in a memory clinic. Results: A more posterior WMH distribution was found to be an independent predictor of pathologic evidence of CAA (p = 0.001, odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] = 1.19 [1.07{\textendash}1.32]), even in the subgroup without lobar MBs (p = 0.016, odds ratio [95\% confidence interval] = 1.18 [1.03{\textendash}1.36]). In the memory clinic cohort, strictly lobar MBs were independently associated with more posterior WMH distribution (p = 0.009). AP distribution of WMH was also associated with location of DPVS (p = 0.001), in that patients with predominant DPVS in the white matter over the basal ganglia harbored a more posterior WMH distribution. Conclusions: Our results suggest that AP distribution of WMH may represent an additional marker of CAA, irrespective of the presence of lobar hemorrhages. Classification of evidence: This study provides Class III evidence that there is a significant association between the AP distribution of WMH on MRI with the presence of pathologically confirmed CAA pathology.},

  abstract = {Background: There are limited data regarding the prevalence of distinct clinical, neuroimaging and genetic markers among patients diagnosed with cerebral amyloid angiopathy{\textendash}related inflammation (CAA-ri). We sought to determine the prevalence of clinical, radiological, genetic and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker findings in patients with CAA-ri. Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis of published studies including patients with CAA-ri was conducted to determine the prevalence of clinical, neuroimaging, genetic and cerebrospinal fluid biomarker findings. Subgroup analyses were performed based on (1) prospective or retrospective study design and (2) CAA-ri diagnosis with or without available biopsy. We pooled the prevalence rates using random-effects models and assessed the heterogeneity using Cochran-Q and I2-statistics. Results: We identified 4 prospective and 17 retrospective cohort studies comprising 378 patients with CAA-ri (mean age, 71.5 years; women, 52\%). The pooled prevalence rates were as follows: cognitive decline at presentation 70\% ([95\% CI, 54\%{\textendash}84\%]; I2=82\%), focal neurological deficits 55\% ([95\% CI, 40\%{\textendash}70\%]; I2=82\%), encephalopathy 54\% ([95\% CI, 39\%{\textendash}68\%]; I2=43\%), seizures 37\% ([95\% CI, 27\%{\textendash}49\%]; I2=65\%), headache 31\% ([95\% CI, 22\%{\textendash}42\%]; I2=58\%), T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-hyperintense white matter lesions 98\% ([95\% CI, 93\%{\textendash}100\%]; I2=44\%), lobar cerebral microbleeds 96\% ([95\% CI, 92\%{\textendash}99\%]; I2=25\%), gadolinium enhancing lesions 54\% ([95\% CI, 42\%{\textendash}66\%]; I2=62\%), cortical superficial siderosis 51\% ([95\% CI, 34\%{\textendash}68\%]; I2=77\%) and lobar macrohemorrhage 40\% ([95\% CI, 11\%{\textendash}73\%]; I2=88\%). The prevalence rate of the ApoE (Apolipoprotein E) {$\epsilon$}4/{$\epsilon$}4 genotype was 34\% ([95\% CI, 17\%{\textendash}53\%]; I2=76\%). Subgroup analyses demonstrated no differences in these prevalence rates based on study design and diagnostic strategy. Conclusions: Cognitive decline was the most common clinical feature. Hyperintense T2/fluid-attenuated inversion recovery white matter lesions and lobar cerebral microbleeds were by far the most prevalent neuroimaging findings. Thirty-four percent of patients with CAA-ri have homozygous ApoE {$\epsilon$}4/{$\epsilon$}4 genotype and scarce data exist regarding the cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and its significance in these patients.},

Whether this translates to humans is largely unknown, as non-invasive brain imaging of the hypothalamus remains challenging. Using a novel multimodal approach with manual segmentation, we here show that body mass index (BMI) selectively predicted higher proton diffusivity within the hypothalamus, indicative of compromised microstructure, in a well-characterized population-based cohort (n1 = 338, 48\% females, age 21-78 years, BMI 18-43 kg/m2). Results were independent from confounders and replicated in another independent sample (n2 = 236) which was processed with a tailored automated segmentation procedure. In addition, while hypothalamic volume was not associated with obesity, we identified a sexual dimorphism and larger hypothalamic volumes in the left compared to the right hemisphere. Our findings underpin the relevance of population neuroimaging to discover structural brain changes in subcortical areas that are crucial for understanding obesity and other eating-related disorders.}

  abstract = {Diurnal fluctuations in MRI measures of structural and functional properties of the brain have been reported recently. These fluctuations may have a physiological origin, since they have been detected using different MRI modalities, and cannot be explained by factors that are typically known to confound MRI measures. While preliminary evidence suggests that measures of structural properties of the brain based on diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) fluctuate as a function of time-of-day (TOD), the underlying mechanism has not been investigated. Here, we used a longitudinal within-subjects design to investigate the impact of time-of-day on DTI measures. In addition to using the conventional monoexponential tensor model to assess TOD-related fluctuations, we used a dual compartment tensor model that allowed us to directly assess if any change in DTI measures is due to an increase in CSF/free-water volume fraction or due to an increase in water diffusivity within the parenchyma. Our results show that Trace or mean diffusivity, as measured using the conventional monoexponential tensor model tends to increase systematically from morning to afternoon scans at the interface of grey matter/CSF, most prominently in the major fissures and the sulci of the brain. Interestingly, in a recent study of the glymphatic system, these same regions were found to show late enhancement after intrathecal injection of a CSF contrast agent. The increase in Trace also impacts DTI measures of diffusivity such as radial and axial diffusivity, but does not affect fractional anisotropy. The dual compartment analysis revealed that the increase in diffusivity measures from PM to AM was driven by an increase in the volume fraction of CSF-like free-water. Taken together, our findings provide important insight into the likely physiological origins of diurnal fluctuations in MRI measurements of structural properties of the brain.}

  abstract = {The Enhancing NeuroImaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Consortium is a collaborative network of researchers working together on a range of large-scale studies that integrate data from 70 institutions worldwide. Organized into Working Groups that tackle questions in neuroscience, genetics, and medicine, ENIGMA studies have analyzed neuroimaging data from over 12,826 subjects. In addition, data from 12,171 individuals were provided by the CHARGE consortium for replication of findings, in a total of 24,997 subjects. By meta-analyzing results from many sites, ENIGMA has detected factors that affect the brain that no individual site could detect on its own, and that require larger numbers of subjects than any individual neuroimaging study has currently collected. ENIGMA's first project was a genome-wide association study identifying common variants in the genome associated with hippocampal volume or intracranial volume. Continuing work is exploring genetic associations with subcortical volumes (ENIGMA2) and white matter microstructure (ENIGMA-DTI). Working groups also focus on understanding how schizophrenia, bipolar illness, major depression and attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) affect the brain. We review the current progress of the ENIGMA Consortium, along with challenges and unexpected discoveries made on the way.}

  abstract = {Cerebral small vessel disease (cSVD) comprises pathological processes of the small vessels in the brain that may manifest clinically as stroke, cognitive impairment, dementia, or gait disturbance. It is generally accepted that endothelial dysfunction, including blood-brain barrier (BBB) failure, is pivotal in the pathophysiology. Recent years have seen increasing use of imaging, primarily dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, to assess BBB leakage, but there is considerable variability in the approaches and findings reported in the literature. Although dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging is well established, challenges emerge in cSVD because of the subtle nature of BBB impairment. The purpose of this work, authored by members of the HARNESS Initiative, is to provide an in-depth review and position statement on magnetic resonance imaging measurement of subtle BBB leakage in clinical research studies, with aspects requiring further research identified. We further aim to provide information and consensus recommendations for new investigators wishing to study BBB failure in cSVD and dementia.},

  abstract = {AIM: It remains unclear whether elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) is a risk factor for cerebral vascular disease. Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is the most appropriate model for understanding the effects of excess LDL-C because affected individuals have inherently high levels of circulating LDL-C. To clarify the effects of hypercholesterolemia on cerebral small vessel disease (SVD), we investigated cerebrovascular damage in detail due to elevated LDL-C using high resolution brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in patients with FH. METHODS: Twenty-eight patients with FH and 35 healthy controls underwent 7T brain MRI. The prevalence of SVD and arterial structural changes were determined in each group. RESULTS: The prevalence of periventricular hyperintensity (PVH) was significantly higher (control, 0\% vs. FH, 14.2\%, p=0.021) and deep white matter intensity tended to be more frequent in FH patients than in controls. The prevalence of SVD in patients with forms of cerebral damage, such as lacunar infarction, PVH, deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMH), microbleeding, and brain atrophy, was significantly higher among FH patients (control, n=2, 5.7\% vs. FH, n=7, 25.0\%, p0.001, chi-square test). The tortuosity of major intracranial arteries and the signal intensity of lenticulostriate arteries were similar in the two groups. In FH patients, as the grade of PVH progressed, several atherosclerosis risk factors, such as body mass index, blood pressure, and triglyceride level, showed ever worsening values. CONCLUSION: These results obtained from FH patients revealed that persistently elevated LDL-C leads to cerebral PVH. It is necessary in the management of FH to pay attention not only to the development of coronary heart disease but also to the presence of cerebral SVD.},

We also consider several limitations of SEM and some misconceptions that it tends to elicit. Major themes emphasized are the problem of omitted variables, the importance of lower-order model components, potential limitations of models judged to be well fitting, the inaccuracy of some commonly used rules of thumb, and the importance of study design. Throughout, we offer recommendations for the conduct of SEM analyses and the reporting of results.}

The purpose of this study is to examine the durability of these diet-induced microstructural alterations. We implemented a crossover experimental design where post-weaned male rats were assigned to one of four experimental diets. Following the administration of experimental diets and again following crossover and resumption of a normal diet, brains were imaged ex-vivo with diffusion tensor imaging. Following standard image preprocessing, tract-based spatial statistics and region-of-interest measurements were then calculated for all diffusion tensor indices. Voxel-wise differences in FA were identified in the high fat diet group when compared to animals receiving a control diet. Following crossover, there were new voxel-wise changes in both FA and TR that do not correspond to the regions previously identified. Animals crossed over from the high fiber diet demonstrate widespread and global changes in the diffusion tensor that stand in stark contrast to the minimal changes identified before crossover. While no significant differences between any of the diffusion metrics were identified in the high protein group before crossover, statistically significant decreased RD values were observed following resumption of a normal diet. Diet-induced changes in neural microstructure are durable changes that are unrecoverable following the resumption of a normal diet. We further show that in certain experimental diets, resumption of a normal diet can lead to further marked and unanticipated changes in white matter microstructure.},

Remaining completely still on command is a major achievement as involuntary fluctuations in our motions are difficult to keep under control. Here we examine the noise-to-signal ratio of micro-movements present in time-series of head motions extracted from resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans in 1048 participants. These included individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and healthy-controls in shared data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) and the Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD-200) databases. We find excess noise and randomness in the ASD cases, suggesting an uncertain motor-feedback signal. A power-law emerged describing an orderly relation between the dispersion and shape of the probability distribution functions best describing the stochastic properties under consideration with respect to intelligence quotient (IQ-scores). In ASD, deleterious patterns of noise are consistently exacerbated with the presence of secondary (comorbid) neuropsychiatric diagnoses, lower verbal and performance intelligence, and autism severity. Importantly, such patterns in ASD are present whether or not the participant takes psychotropic medication. These data unambiguously establish specific noise-to-signal levels of head micro-movements as a biologically informed core feature of ASD.},

Our understanding of the stress-eating relation is confounded by limitations inherent in the study designs; however, we can make some tentative conclusions that support the notion that stress can influence eating patterns in humans. Stress appears to alter overall food intake in two ways, resulting in under- or overeating, which may be influenced by stressor severity. Chronic life stress seems to be associated with a greater preference for energy- and nutrient-dense foods, namely those that are high in sugar and fat. Evidence from longitudinal studies suggests that chronic life stress may be causally linked to weight gain, with a greater effect seen in men. Stress-induced eating may be one factor contributing to the development of obesity. Future studies that measure biological markers of stress will assist our understanding of the physiologic mechanism underlying the stress-eating relation and how stress might be linked to neurotransmitters and hormones that control appetite.},

Leukoencephalopathy and cerebral atrophy, resembling that encountered in diabetic humans, developed in diabetic mice and was accompanied by time-related development of cognitive changes in behavioural testing. Increased RAGE (receptor for advanced glycation end products) expression, a mediator of widespread diabetic complications, increased dramatically at sites of white matter damage in regions of myelination. RAGE expression was also elevated within neurons, astrocytes and microglia in grey matter and within oligodendrocytes in white matter. RAGE null diabetic mice had significantly less neurodegenerative changes when compared to wild-type diabetic mice.

  abstract = {Multi-state models allow subjects to move among a finite number of states during a follow-up period. Most often, the objects of study are the transition intensities. The impact of covariates on them can also be studied by specifying regression models. Thus, estimation in multi-state models is usually focused on the transition intensities (or the cumulative transition intensities) and on the regression parameters. However, from a clinical or epidemiological point of view, other quantities could provide additional information and may be more relevant to answer practical questions. For example, given a set of covariates for a subject, it may be of interest to estimate the probability to experience a future event or the expected time without any event. To address these kinds of issues, we need to estimate quantities such as transition probabilities, cumulative probabilities and life expectancies. The purpose of this paper is to review a large number of these quantities in an illness-death model which is perhaps the most common multi-state model in the medical literature, and to propose a way to estimate them in addition to the transition intensities and the regression parameters. An illustration is given using interval-censored data from a large cohort study on cognitive ageing.}

Replication of novel loci was performed in an independent dataset of 1,202 individuals. In all studies, WMH were quantified using validated automated or semi-automated methods. Imputation was to either the Haplotype Reference Consortium or 1,000 Genomes Phase 3 panels.Results We identified a locus at genome-wide significance in an intron of PLEKHG1 (rs275350, {$\beta$} [SE] = 0.071 [0.013]; p = 1.6 {\texttimes} 10-8), a Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor that is involved in reorientation of cells in the vascular endothelium. This association was validated in an independent sample (overall p value, 2.4 {\texttimes} 10-9). The same single nucleotide polymorphism was associated with all ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] [95\% confidence interval (CI)] 1.07 [1.03{\textendash}1.12], p = 0.00051), most strongly with the small vessel subtype (OR [95\% CI] 1.09 [1.00{\textendash}1.19], p = 0.044). Previous associations at 17q25 and 2p16 reached genome-wide significance in this analysis (rs3744020; {$\beta$} [SE] = 0.106 [0.016]; p = 1.2 {\texttimes} 10-11 and rs7596872; {$\beta$} [SE] = 0.143 [0.021]; p = 3.4 {\texttimes} 10-12). All identified associations with WMH to date explained 1.16\% of the trait variance in UK Biobank, equivalent to 6.4\% of the narrow-sense heritability.Conclusions Genetic variation in PLEKHG1 is associated with WMH and ischemic stroke, most strongly with the small vessel subtype, suggesting it acts by promoting small vessel arteriopathy.BIANCA=Brain Intensity Abnormality Classification Algorithm; CADASIL=cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; CI=confidence interval; FLAIR=fluid-attenuated inversion recovery; GC=genomic control; GENESIS=Genes and Ischaemic Stroke; GWAS=genome-wide association studies; HRC=Haplotype Reference Consortium; ICA=intracranial area; ICD-9=International Classification of Diseases{\textendash}9; ICD-10=International Classification of Diseases{\textendash}10; ICH=intracerebral hemorrhage; MGH=Massachusetts General Hospital; OR=odds ratio; PLEKHG1=pleckstrin homology and Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor domain containing G1; Rho-GEF=Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor; ROI=region of interest; SGUL=St. George\&\#039;s, University of London; SLESS=South London Ethnicity and Stroke Study; SNP=single nucleotide polymorphism; SVD=small vessel disease; TI=inversion time; TICV=total intracranial volume; TR=repetition time; WMH=white matter hyperintensities; WTCCC2=Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2}

To better understand the neurobiology of this process and how it may be dysfunctional in obesity, this study examined activity of the brain's "default network" in reduced-obese (RO) as compared to lean individuals. The default network is a group of functionally connected brain regions thought to play an important role in internally directed cognitive activity and the interplay between external and internal sensory processing. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed in 24 lean and 18 RO individuals in the fasted state after 2 days of eucaloric energy intake and after 2 days of 30\% overfeeding in a counterbalanced design. Scanning was performed while subjects passively viewed images of food and nonfood objects. Independent component analysis was used to identify the default network component. In the eucaloric state, greater default network activity was observed in RO compared to lean individuals in the lateral inferior parietal and posterior cingulate cortices. Activity was positively correlated with appetite. Overfeeding resulted in increased default network activity in lean but not RO individuals. These findings suggest that the function of the default network, a major contributor to intrinsic neuronal activity, is altered in obesity and/or obese-prone individuals. Future studies of the network's function and its relationship to other brain networks may improve our understanding of the mechanisms and treatment of obesity.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We measured total and regional body composition to evaluate the differences in body composition associated with menopause and to determine whether the changes in fat distribution were more related to age or to menopause. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred five healthy white women who had never received estrogen replacement therapy were studied according to menopausal status and age. Bone mass and body composition were measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry. The proportions of android and gynoid fat were calculated in all women and differences were sought by statistical analysis. RESULTS: Compared with premenopausal women, postmenopausal women were characterized by a significant increase in the proportion of android fat and the ratio trunk fat/leg fat, whereas the absolute amount of body fat mass did not significantly change. The different variables of android fat distribution tended to correlate better with years since menopause than with age. In multiple linear regression, years since menopause was a predictor of body fat mass and fat trunk, whereas age was not a predictor of any of the fat distribution variables. CONCLUSIONS: This study underlines the early changes in body fat distribution with a shift of body fat toward a more central location in postmenopausal women. This change in fat distribution appears to be more related to menopause than to age and might, together with other factors, contribute to explain the increased cardiovascular risk reported in postmenopausal women.},

Nevertheless, it remains unknown whether obesity has a causal influence on cerebral atrophy. We recruited 47 morbidly obese subjects (mean BMI?=?42.2, SD?=?4.0, 42 females and five males) eligible for bariatric surgery and 29 non-obese subjects (mean BMI?=?23.2, SD?=?2.8, 23 females and six males) served as controls. Baseline scans were acquired with T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 1.5 Tesla; obese participants were scanned again six months after the surgery. Local GM and WM densities were quantified using VBM. Full-volume analyses were used for comparing baseline between-group differences as well as the effects of surgery-induced weight loss in the morbidly obese. Metabolic variables were used in linear models to predict WM and GM densities. Obese subjects had initially lower GM densities in widespread cortical areas including frontal, parietal, and temporal regions as well as insulae. Lower WM densities were observed throughout the WM. Bariatric surgery and concomitant weight loss resulted in global increase in WM density. Grey matter increase was limited to occipital and inferior temporal regions. Metabolic variables were associated with brain densities. We conclude that weight loss results in global recovery of WM as well as local recovery of grey matter densities. These changes likely reflect improved brain tissue integrity. Hum Brain Mapp 37:3745?3756, 2016. ? 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The current study tested whether the heritable variance in body mass index (BMI) is explained by brain and behavioral factors in a large brain imaging cohort that included multiple related individuals. We found that the heritable variance in BMI had genetic correlations 0.25{\textendash}0.45 with cognitive tests, cortical thickness, and regional brain volume. In particular, BMI was associated with frontal lobe asymmetry and differences in temporal-parietal perceptual systems. Further, we found genetic overlap between certain brain and behavioral factors. In summary, the genetic vulnerability to BMI is expressed in the brain. This may inform intervention strategies.Recent molecular genetic studies have shown that the majority of genes associated with obesity are expressed in the central nervous system. Obesity has also been associated with neurobehavioral factors such as brain morphology, cognitive performance, and personality. Here, we tested whether these neurobehavioral factors were associated with the heritable variance in obesity measured by body mass index (BMI) in the Human Connectome Project (n = 895 siblings). Phenotypically, cortical thickness findings supported the ``right brain hypothesis'' for obesity. Namely, increased BMI is associated with decreased cortical thickness in right frontal lobe and increased thickness in the left frontal lobe, notably in lateral prefrontal cortex. In addition, lower thickness and volume in entorhinal-parahippocampal structures and increased thickness in parietal-occipital structures in participants with higher BMI supported the role of visuospatial function in obesity. Brain morphometry results were supported by cognitive tests, which outlined a negative association between BMI and visuospatial function, verbal episodic memory, impulsivity, and cognitive flexibility. Personality{\textendash}BMI correlations were inconsistent. We then aggregated the effects for each neurobehavioral factor for a behavioral genetics analysis and estimated each factor's genetic overlap with BMI. Cognitive test scores and brain morphometry had 0.25{\textendash}0.45 genetic correlations with BMI, and the phenotypic correlations with BMI were 77{\textendash}89\% explained by genetic factors. Neurobehavioral factors also had some genetic overlap with each other. In summary, obesity as measured by BMI has considerable genetic overlap with brain and cognitive measures. This supports the theory that obesity is inherited via brain function and may inform intervention strategies.}

These mechanisms can affordably be studied via neurobehavioural measures. Here, we systematically review these efforts, evaluating neurocognitive tests and personality questionnaires based on: a) consistent relationship with obesity and eating behaviour, and b) reliability. We also considered the measures' potential to shed light on the brain mechanisms underlying these individual differences. Sixty-six neurocognitive tasks were examined. Less than 11\%, mainly measures of executive functions and food motivation, yielded both replicated and reliable effects. Several different personality questionnaires were consistently related to BMI. However, further analysis found that many of these questionnaires relate closely to Conscientiousness, Extraversion and Neuroticism within the Five-Factor Model of personality. Both neurocognitive tests and personality questionnaires suggest that the critical neural systems related to individual differences in obesity are lateral prefrontal structures underpinning self-control and striatal regions implicated in food motivation. This review can guide selection of the highest yield neurobehavioural measures for future studies.}

Lesion studies in rodents suggest that these two distinct components of instrumental conditioning may be mediated by anatomically distinct neural systems. The aim of the present study was to determine the neural substrates of the goal-directed component of instrumental learning in humans. Nineteen human subjects were scanned with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they learned to choose instrumental actions that were associated with the subsequent delivery of different food rewards (tomato juice, chocolate milk, and orange juice). After training, one of these foods was devalued by feeding the subject to satiety on that food. The subjects were then scanned again, while being re-exposed to the instrumental choice procedure (in extinction). We hypothesized that regions of the brain involved in goal-directed learning would show changes in their activity as a function of outcome devaluation. Our results indicate that neural activity in one brain region in particular, the orbitofrontal cortex, showed a strong modulation in its activity during selection of a devalued compared with a nondevalued action. These results suggest an important contribution of orbitofrontal cortex in guiding goal-directed instrumental choices in humans.}

Patients with the metabolic syndrome, a major risk factor for diabetes, may display comparable cognitive decrements as seen in type 2 diabetes. Currently, the impact of diabetes and prediabetes on cognition and the underlying organization of functional brain networks still remain to be elucidated. This study investigated whether functional brain networks are affected in type 2 diabetes and prediabetes. Forty-seven participants with diabetes, 47 participants with prediabetes, and 45 control participants underwent detailed cognitive testing and 3-Tesla resting state functional MRI. Graph theoretical network analysis was performed to investigate alterations in functional cerebral networks. Participants with diabetes displayed altered network measures, characterized by a higher normalized cluster coefficient and higher local efficiency, compared with control participants. The network measures of the participants with prediabetes fell between those with diabetes and control participants. Lower processing speed was associated with shorter path length and higher global efficiency. Participants with type 2 diabetes have altered functional brain networks. This alteration is already apparent in the prediabetic stage to a somewhat lower level, hinting at functional reorganization of the cerebral networks as a compensatory mechanism for cognitive decrements.},

The metabolic syndrome also appears to predispose to cognitive dysfunction and dementia. In this study the association between the metabolic syndrome and cognitive function was examined in a population of the oldest old. Methods: The Leiden 85-Plus Study is a population-based study of 599 persons from age 85 onward. Cognitive function was assessed annually from age 85 to 90 by means of four neuropsychological tests. The presence (n = 237) or absence (n = 325) of the metabolic syndrome was recorded at baseline. Cross-sectional and prospective associations between the metabolic syndrome and cognitive function were analyzed with linear mixed models, adjusted for sex and level of education. Results: At age 85 the metabolic syndrome was not associated with lower cognitive performance. The metabolic syndrome was associated with a decelerated cognitive decline from age 85 to 90 on the Mini-Mental State Examination (additional annual effect 0.18 [0.07], p = 0.01), the Stroop Test (-1.49 [0.59], p = 0.01), and the Letter Digit Coding Test (0.26 [0.09], p = 0.005). This effect was mainly attributable to glucose, body mass index, and, to a lesser extent, blood pressure. Conclusion: The association between the metabolic syndrome and accelerated cognitive decline, which has been reported in persons up to age 75, is not evident in a population of the oldest old. The concept of the metabolic syndrome may be less valid in this age group.}

  abstract = {Vascular risk factors, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidemia and obesity, have been associated with an increased risk of cognitive dysfunction, particularly in the elderly. The aim of this systematic review was to compare these risk factors with regard to the nature and magnitude of the associated cognitive decrements. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies that assessed cognitive functioning in non-demented persons in relation to diabetes/impaired glucose metabolism (k=36), hypertension (k=24), dyslipidemia (k=7) and obesity (k=6) and that adjusted or matched for age, gender and education were included. When possible, effect sizes (Cohen's d) were computed per cognitive domain. Diabetes and hypertension were clearly associated with cognitive decrements; the results for obesity and dyslipidemia were less consistent. Effect sizes were moderate (median{\textasciitilde}-0.3) for all risk factors. Decline was found in all cognitive domains, although the effects on cognitive speed, mental flexibility and memory were most consistent. Methodological aspects of included studies and implications of these findings are discussed.},

Participants were randomly assigned to 1,800 mg/d EPA{\textendash}DHA, 400 mg/d EPA{\textendash}DHA, or placebo capsules for 26 weeks. Cognitive performance was assessed using an extensive neuropsychological test battery that included the cognitive domains of attention, sensorimotor speed, memory, and executive function.Results: The mean age of the participants was 70 years, and 55\% were male. Plasma concentrations of EPA{\textendash}DHA increased by 238\% in the high-dose and 51\% in the low-dose fish oil group compared with placebo, reflecting excellent compliance. Baseline scores on the cognitive tests were comparable in the three groups. Overall, there were no significant differential changes in any of the cognitive domains for either low-dose or high-dose fish oil supplementation compared with placebo.Conclusions: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we observed no overall effect of 26 weeks of eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid supplementation on cognitive performance.}

While fcMRI does not provide direct measurement of anatomic connectivity, accumulating evidence suggests it is sufficiently constrained by anatomy to allow the architecture of distinct brain systems to be characterized. fcMRI is particularly useful for characterizing large-scale systems that span distributed areas (e.g., polysynaptic cortical pathways, cerebro-cerebellar circuits, cortical-thalamic circuits) and has complementary strengths when contrasted with the other major tool available for human connectomics{\textemdash}high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We review what is known about fcMRI and then explore fcMRI data reliability, effects of preprocessing, analysis procedures, and effects of different acquisition parameters across six studies (n = 98) to provide recommendations for optimization. Run length (2{\textendash}12 min), run structure (1 12-min run or 2 6-min runs), temporal resolution (2.5 or 5.0 s), spatial resolution (2 or 3 mm), and the task (fixation, eyes closed rest, eyes open rest, continuous word-classification) were varied. Results revealed moderate to high test-retest reliability. Run structure, temporal resolution, and spatial resolution minimally influenced fcMRI results while fixation and eyes open rest yielded stronger correlations as contrasted to other task conditions. Commonly used preprocessing steps involving regression of nuisance signals minimized nonspecific (noise) correlations including those associated with respiration. The most surprising finding was that estimates of correlation strengths stabilized with acquisition times as brief as 5 min. The brevity and robustness of fcMRI positions it as a powerful tool for large-scale explorations of genetic influences on brain architecture. We conclude by discussing the strengths and limitations of fcMRI and how it can be combined with HARDI techniques to support the emerging field of human connectomics.}

Methods: From a randomized controlled trial (PROSPER study), a study sample of 89 patients with DM and 438 control subjects without DM aged 70{\textendash}82 years were included for brain MRI scanning and cognitive function testing at baseline and reexamination after 3 years. Changes in brain atrophy, white matter hyperintensities (WMHs), number of infarctions, and cognitive function test results were determined in patients with DM and subjects without DM. Linear regression analysis was performed with correction for age, gender, hypertension, pravastatin treatment, educational level, and baseline test results. In patients with DM, baseline MRI parameters were correlated with change in cognitive function test result using linear regression analysis with covariates age and gender. Results: Patients with DM showed increased progression of brain atrophy (p \&amp;lt; 0.01) after follow-up compared to control subjects. No difference in progression of WMH volume or infarctions was found. Patients with DM showed increased decline in cognitive performance on Stroop Test (p = 0.04) and Picture Learning Test (p = 0.03). Furthermore, in patients with DM, change in Picture Learning Test was associated with baseline brain atrophy (p \&amp;lt; 0.02). Conclusion: Our data show that elderly patients with DM without dementia have accelerated progression of brain atrophy with significant consequences in cognition compared to subjects without DM. Our findings add further evidence to the hypothesis that diabetes exerts deleterious effects on neuronal integrity.}

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Recent studies have shown that neuroimaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease can also regress over time. We investigated the cognitive consequences of regression of small vessel disease markers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred and seventy-six participants of the RUNDMC study underwent neuroimaging and cognitive assessments at three time-points over 8.7 years. We semi-automatically assessed white matter hyperintensities volumes and manually rated lacunes and microbleeds. We analysed differences in cognitive decline and accompanying brain atrophy between participants with regression, progression and stable small vessel disease by analysis of variance. RESULTS: Fifty-six participants (20.3\%) showed regression of small vessel disease markers: 31 (11.2\%) white matter hyperintensities regression, 10 (3.6\%) vanishing lacunes and 27 (9.8\%) vanishing microbleeds. Participants with regression showed a decline in overall cognition, memory, psychomotor speed and executive function similar to stable small vessel disease. Participants with small vessel disease progression showed more cognitive decline compared with stable small vessel disease (p\,{$<$}\,0.001 for cognitive index and memory; p\,{$<$}\,0.01 for executive function), although significance disappeared after adjusting for age and sex. Loss of total brain, gray matter and white matter volume did not differ between participants with small vessel disease regression and stable small vessel disease, while participants with small vessel disease progression showed more volume loss of total brain and gray matter compared to those with stable small vessel disease (p\,{$<$}\,0.05), although significance disappeared after adjustments. DISCUSSION: Regression of small vessel disease markers was associated with similar cognitive decline compared to stable small vessel disease and did not accompany brain atrophy, suggesting that small vessel disease regression follows a relatively benign clinical course. Future studies are required to validate these findings and to assess the role of vascular risk factor control on small vessel disease regression and possible recovery of clinical symptoms. CONCLUSION: Our findings of comparable cognitive decline between participants with regression and stable small vessel disease might suggest that small vessel disease regression has a relative benign cognitive outcome.

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the temporal dynamics of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) by 3 consecutive assessments over a period of 9 years, distinguishing progression from regression. METHODS: Changes in SVD markers of 276 participants of the Radboud University Nijmegen Diffusion Tensor and Magnetic Resonance Imaging Cohort (RUN DMC) cohort were assessed at 3 time points over 9 years. We assessed white matter hyperintensities (WMH) volume by semiautomatic segmentation and rated lacunes and microbleeds manually. We categorized baseline WMH severity as mild, moderate, or severe according to the modified Fazekas scale. We performed mixed-effects regression analysis including a quadratic term for increasing age. RESULTS: Mean WMH progression over 9 years was 4.7 mL (0.54 mL/y; interquartile range 0.95-5.5 mL), 20.3\% of patients had incident lacunes (2.3\%/y), and 18.9\% had incident microbleeds (2.2\%/y). WMH volume declined in 9.4\% of the participants during the first follow-up interval, but only for 1 participant (0.4\%) throughout the whole follow-up. Lacunes disappeared in 3.6\% and microbleeds in 5.7\% of the participants. WMH progression accelerated over time: including a quadratic term for increasing age during follow-up significantly improved the model (p {$<$} 0.001). SVD progression was predominantly seen in participants with moderate to severe WMH at baseline compared to those with mild WMH (odds ratio [OR] 35.5, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 15.8-80.0, p {$<$} 0.001 for WMH progression; OR 5.7, 95\% CI 2.8-11.2, p {$<$} 0.001 for incident lacunes; and OR 2.9, 95\% CI 1.4-5.9, p = 0.003 for incident microbleeds). CONCLUSIONS: SVD progression is nonlinear, accelerating over time, and a highly dynamic process, with progression interrupted by reduction in some, in a population that on average shows progression.},

  abstract = {Background: The relationship between cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) and dementia has been studied without considering white matter (WM) volume, the microstructural integrity of the WM surrounding the SVD, and grey matter (GM). Objective: We prospectively investigated the relationship between these structures and the risk of dementia, and formed a prediction model to investigate which characteristics (macro- or microstructural) explained most of the variance. Methods: The RUN DMC study is a prospective cohort study among 503 non-demented participants with an age between 50 and 85 years at baseline, with baseline assessment in 2006 and follow-up assessment in 2012. Two were lost to follow-up (yielding a 99.6\% response-rate). Cox regression analysis was used, to calculate hazard ratios for dementia, of baseline MRI characteristics. Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) analysis was used to assess the added value of microstructural integrity of the WM. Results: Mean age at baseline was 65.6 years (SD 8.8) and 56.8\% was male. 43 participants developed dementia (8.6\% ), resulting in a 5.5-year cumulative risk of 11.1\% (95\% CI 7.7{\textendash}14.6). Low WM and hippocampal volume are significant predictors for dementia. WM, WM hyperintensities, and hippocampal volume explained most of the variance. TBSS analyses showed no additional value of diffusion parameters. Conclusions: WM and hippocampal volume were the main predictors for the development of incident dementia at 5-year follow-up in elderly with SVD. There was no additional diagnostic value of the diffusion tensor imaging parameters on top of the macrostructural characteristics.},

We estimated structural correlation from magnetic resonance imaging measures of cortical thickness at 308 regions in a sample of N = 297 healthy participants, aged 14{\textendash}24 years. We used a novel sliding-window analysis to measure age-related changes in network attributes globally, locally and in the context of several community partitions of the network. We found that the strength of structural correlation generally decreased as a function of age. Association cortical regions demonstrated a sharp decrease in nodal degree (hubness) from 14 years, reaching a minimum at approximately 19 years, and then levelling off or even slightly increasing until 24 years. Greater and more prolonged age-related changes in degree of cortical regions within the brain network were associated with faster rates of adolescent cortical myelination and shrinkage. The brain regions that demonstrated the greatest age-related changes were concentrated within prefrontal modules. We conclude that human adolescence is associated with biologically plausible changes in structural imaging markers of brain network organization, consistent with the concept of tuning or consolidating anatomical connectivity between frontal cortex and the rest of the connectome.}

  abstract = {The most common cause of vascular cognitive impairment not demented (VCIND) is cerebral small vessel disease leading to diffuse subcortical white matter lesions. While many studies indicate that the core cognitive features of VCIND are executive dysfunction and impaired processing speed, this finding is not always consistent, and may be partially dependent on the comparison group applied. Hence, we undertook two systematic meta-analytic reviews on neuropsychological test performance across eight cognitive domains: between VCIND and healthy controls (data from 27 studies), and between VCIND and non-vascular mild cognitive impairment (nv-MCI; data from 20 studies). Our quantitative synthesis of the research literature demonstrates that individuals with VCIND show weaknesses across all cognitive domains relative to healthy controls, with the greatest impairment in the domain of processing speed (Md~=~?1.36), and the least affected being working memory (Md~=~?.48) and visuospatial construction (Md~=~?.63). When compared directly with nv-MCI, individuals with VCIND had significantly greater deficits in processing speed (Md~=~?.55) and executive functioning (Md~=~?.40), while those with nv-MCI exhibited a greater relative deficit in delayed memory (Md~=~.41). Our analyses indicate that disruption to subcortical white matter tracts impairs more cognitive processes than is typically thought to be directly related to the fronto-subcortical network. The data also suggest that differing brain aetiologies can be responsible for similar cognitive profiles. Although the findings do not evince diagnostic value, they allude to the interconnectivity of disparate cognitive processes and call for further research on the behavioural outcome of network disruption.},

  abstract = {Objectives White matter hyperintensities (WMHs) are considered macroscale markers of cerebrovascular burden and are associated with increased risk of vascular cognitive impairment and dementia. However, the spatial location of WMHs has typically been considered in broad categories of periventricular versus deep white matter. The spatial distribution of WHMs associated with individual cerebrovascular risk factors (CVR), controlling for frequently comorbid risk factors, has not been systematically investigated at the population level in a healthy ageing cohort. Furthermore, there is an inconsistent relationship between total white matter hyperintensity load and cognition, which may be due to the confounding of several simultaneous risk factors in models based on smaller cohorts. Methods We examined trends in individual CVR factors on total WMH burden in 13,680 individuals (aged 45{\textendash}80) using data from the UK Biobank. We estimated the spatial distribution of white matter hyperintensities associated with each risk factor and their contribution to explaining total WMH load using voxel-wise probit regression and univariate linear regression. Finally, we explored the impact of CVR-related WMHs on speed of processing using regression and mediation analysis. Results Contrary to the assumed dominance of hypertension as the biggest predictor of WMH burden, we show associations with a number of risk factors including diabetes, heavy smoking, APOE {$\epsilon$}4/{$\epsilon$}4 status and high waist-to-hip ratio of similar, or greater magnitude to hypertension. The spatial distribution of WMHs varied considerably with individual cerebrovascular risk factors. There were independent effects of visceral adiposity, as measured by waist-to-hip ratio, and carriage of the APOE {$\epsilon$}4 allele in terms of the unique spatial distribution of CVR-related WMHs. Importantly, the relationship between total WMH load and speed of processing was mediated by waist-to-hip ratio suggesting cognitive consequences to WMHs associated with excessive visceral fat deposition. Conclusion Waist-to-hip ratio, diabetes, heavy smoking, hypercholesterolemia and homozygous APOE {$\epsilon$}4 status are important risk factors, beyond hypertension, associated with WMH total burden and warrant careful control across ageing. The spatial distribution associated with different risk factors may provide important clues as to the pathogenesis and cognitive consequences of WMHs. High waist-to-hip ratio is a key risk factor associated with slowing in speed of processing. With global obesity levels rising, focused management of visceral adiposity may present a useful strategy for the mitigation of cognitive decline in ageing.},

Cerebrovascular risk factors increase the likelihood of dementia in older people but their impact on cognitive ageing in younger, healthy brains is less clear. The UK Biobank provides cognition and brain imaging measures in the largest population cohort studied to date. Here we show that cognitive abilities of healthy individuals (N\,=\,22,059) in this sample are detrimentally affected by cerebrovascular risk factors. Structural equation modelling revealed that cerebrovascular risk is associated with reduced cerebral grey matter and white matter integrity within a fronto-parietal brain network underlying executive function. Notably, higher systolic blood pressure was associated with worse executive cognitive function in mid-life (44{\textendash}69 years), but not in late-life ({$>$}70 years). During mid-life this association did not occur in the systolic range of 110{\textendash}140\,mmHg.

Methods We identified 1,230 elderly subjects (aged {$\geq$}50?years) with an average of 4.9?years of clinical follow-up and with amyloid positron emission tomography, diffusion tensor imaging, and structural magnetic resonance imaging scans from the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging. We examined imaging markers of amyloid and brain health (white matter microstructural integrity and cortical thinning), systemic vascular health preceding the imaging markers, and early to midlife intellectual enrichment to predict longitudinal cognitive trajectories. We used latent growth curve models for modeling longitudinal cognitive decline. Results All the pathways (amyloid, vascular, resilience) converged through their effects on cortical thinning and worsening cognition and together explained patterns in cognitive decline. Resilience and vascular pathways (aging process, sex differences, education/occupation, and systemic vascular health) had significant impact on white matter microstructural integrity. Education/occupation levels contributed to white matter integrity through systemic vascular health. Worsening white matter integrity contributed to significant cortical thinning and subsequently longitudinal cognitive decline. Baseline amyloidosis contributed to a significant proportion of cognitive decline that accelerated with longer follow-up times, and its primary impact was through cortical thinning. Interpretation We developed an integrated framework to help explain the dynamic and complex process of cognitive aging by considering key causal pathways. Such an approach is important for both better comprehension of cognitive aging processes and will aid in the development of successful intervention strategies. ANN NEUROL 2019;86:866?877}

Our objectives were to apply a time-to-event voxel-based analytic method to identify regions on MRI where atrophy is associated with significantly increased risk of future progression to AD in subjects with MCI and to compare it to traditional voxel-level patterns obtained by applying two-sample methods. We also compared the power required to detect an association using time-to-event methods versus two-sample approaches. Methods Subjects with MCI at baseline were followed prospectively. The event of interest was clinical diagnosis of AD. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and education were used to estimate the relative hazard of progression from MCI to AD based on rank-transformed voxel-level gray matter density (GMD) estimates. Results The greatest risk of progression to AD was associated with atrophy of the medial temporal lobes. Patients ranked at the 25th percentile of GMD in these regions had more than a doubling of risk of progression to AD at a given time point compared to patients at the 75th percentile. Power calculations showed the time-to-event approach to be more efficient than the traditional two-sample approach. Conclusions We present a new voxel-based analytic method that incorporates time-to-event statistical methods. In the context of a progressive disease like AD, time-to-event VBM seems more appropriate and powerful than traditional two-sample methods.},

Methods: We exploit redundancy in non-Gaussian distributed multidirectional diffusion MRI data by identifying its noise-only principal components, based on the theory of noisy covariance matrices. The bulk of principal component analysis eigenvalues, arising due to noise, is described by the universal Marchenko-Pastur distribution, parameterized by the noise level. This allows us to estimate noise level in a local neighborhood based on the singular value decomposition of a matrix combining neighborhood voxels and diffusion directions. Results: We present a model-independent local noise mapping method capable of estimating the noise level down to about 1\% error. In contrast to current state-of-the-art techniques, the resultant noise maps do not show artifactual anatomical features that often reflect physiological noise, the presence of sharp edges, or a lack of adequate a priori knowledge of the expected form of MR signal. Conclusions: Simulations and experiments show that typical diffusion MRI data exhibit sufficient redundancy that enables accurate, precise, and robust estimation of the local noise level by interpreting the principal component analysis eigenspectrum in terms of the Marchenko-Pastur distribution.

Cocaine users further showed increased dorsomedial PFC (dmPFC) activation relative to pathological gamblers during perseveration, and decreased dorsolateral PFC activation relative to pathological gamblers and controls during shifting. Preliminary genetic findings indicated that cocaine users carrying the DRD2/ANKK Taq1A1+ genotype may derive unique stimulatory effects on shifting-related ventrolateral PFC signal.ConclusionsReduced ventrolateral PFC activation during shifting may constitute a common neural marker across gambling and cocaine addictions. Additional cocaine-related effects relate to a wider pattern of task-related dysregulation, reflected in signal abnormalities in dorsolateral and dmPFC.}

Until recently, little was known about the relevance of these lesions. In this systematic review, we give an overview of the frequency, causes, and consequences of MRI-defined silent brain infarcts, which are detected in 20\% of healthy elderly people and up to 50\% of patients in selected series. Most infarcts are lacunes, of which hypertensive small-vessel disease is thought to be the main cause. Although silent infarcts, by definition, lack clinically overt stroke-like symptoms, they are associated with subtle deficits in physical and cognitive function that commonly go unnoticed. Moreover, the presence of silent infarcts more than doubles the risk of subsequent stroke and dementia. Future studies will have to show whether screening and treating high-risk patients can effectively reduce the risk of further infarcts, stroke, and dementia.}

We performed multisequence magnetic resonance imaging, which included diffusion tensor imaging, and extensive neuropsychological testing. Fractional anisotropy, mean diffusivity, and directional diffusivities were measured globally in white matter lesions and normal-appearing white matter.Performance on neuropsychological tests in the following cognitive domains: memory, executive function, information processing speed, global cognition, and motor speed.Regardless of macrostructural white matter changes, a higher mean diffusivity or higher axial and radial diffusivities within white matter lesions or normal-appearing white matter were related to worse performance on tasks assessing information processing speed and global cognition. In addition, diffusivity within white matter lesions related to memory, while in normal-appearing white matter, it furthermore related to executive function. Lower mean fractional anisotropy in white matter lesions or normal-appearing white matter related to worse information processing speed and motor speed.Microstructural integrity of both white matter lesions and normal-appearing white matter is associated with cognitive function, regardless of white matter atrophy and white matter lesion volume.

We tested whether composite indicators of cardiovascular, lipid, glucose, and inflammatory factors would mediate the adiposity-related variation in white matter microstructure, measured with diffusion tensor imaging on a group of neurologically healthy adults (N=155). A composite factor representing adiposity (comprised of body mass index and waist circumference) was associated with smaller fractional anisotropy and greater radial diffusivity throughout the brain, a pattern previously linked to myelin structure changes in non-human animal models. A similar global negative association was found for factors representing inflammation and, to a lesser extent, glucose regulation. In contrast, factors for blood pressure and dyslipidemia had positive associations with white matter in isolated brain regions. Taken together, these competing influences on the diffusion signal were significant mediators linking adiposity to white matter and explained up to fifty-percent of the adiposity{\textendash}white matter variance. These results provide the first evidence for contrasting physiological pathways, a globally distributed immunity-linked negative component and a more localized vascular-linked positive component, that associate adiposity to individual differences in the microstructure of white matter tracts in otherwise healthy adults.},

  abstract = {Deep learning (DL) is a family of machine learning methods that has gained considerable attention in the scientific community, breaking benchmark records in areas such as speech and visual recognition. DL differs from conventional machine learning methods by virtue of its ability to learn the optimal representation from the raw data through consecutive nonlinear transformations, achieving increasingly higher levels of abstraction and complexity. Given its ability to detect abstract and complex patterns, DL has been applied in neuroimaging studies of psychiatric and neurological disorders, which are characterised by subtle and diffuse alterations. Here we introduce the underlying concepts of DL and review studies that have used this approach to classify brain-based disorders. The results of these studies indicate that DL could be a powerful tool in the current search for biomarkers of psychiatric and neurologic disease. We conclude our review by discussing the main promises and challenges of using DL to elucidate brain-based disorders, as well as possible directions for future research.},

  abstract = {Given the limited success of therapeutic interventions for Alzheimer disease, there is increased interest in understanding whether modifiable factors can help cope with or postpone the appearance of brain pathology. It is estimated that about 35\% of Alzheimer risk is modifiable. Epidemiologic studies have shown that lifetime exposures to higher education, higher occupational attainment, and cognitively stimulating activities are associated with reduced risk of Alzheimer dementia. Autopsy studies have shown interindividual differences in the amount of brain pathology people can tolerate before manifesting cognitive impairments, and autopsied brains of about one-third of individuals who are cognitively normal meet neuropathological criteria for Alzheimer disease. About a decade ago, the concept of cognitive reserve was proposed to account for the discrepancy between brain pathology and cognitive status. The broad hypothesis was that individuals with enriched lifelong exposures would be able to better tolerate with brain pathology in late life. Many studies have investigated how one can cope with brain damage using proxies of neurodegeneration or synaptic integrity. However, the gold standard for testing the reserve hypothesis is the direct measurement of brain pathology at autopsy.}

DESIGN: Population-based cohort study; mean follow-up was 5.4y. SETTING: The Rotterdam Study. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 6296 men and women; baseline age 55-102y. MEASUREMENTS: Sex-specific all-cause mortality was compared between quintiles of BMI, WHR and waist circumference and between predefined categories of BMI and waist circumference, stratified for smoking category. RESULTS: High quintiles of waist circumference, but not high quintiles of BMI and WHR were related to increased mortality among never smoking men, without reaching statistical significance. Only the highest category of BMI (BMI {$>$} 30 kg/m(2)) among never smoking men was related to increased mortality, compared to normal BMI (hazard ratio 2.6 (95\% confidence interval: 1.3-5.3)). Waist circumference between 94 and 102 cm and waist circumference 102 cm and larger were related to increased mortality, compared to normal waist circumference (hazard ratios 1.7 (95\% confidence interval 1.1-2.8) and 1.6 (95\% confidence interval 1.0-2.8), respectively). The proportion of mortality attributable to large waist circumference among never smoking men was three-fold the proportion attributable to high BMI. Among never smoking women and ex- and current smokers, categories of large body fatness did not predict increased mortality. CONCLUSION: Among never smoking elderly men waist circumference may have more potential for detecting overweight than the BMI.},

Our aim was to evaluate whether polymorphisms previously established as predictors of LOAD also predict worse cognitive function and accelerated decline across multiple cognitive domains. We analyzed data from the 3C-Dijon study, in which 4931 respondents aged 65+ were examined up to 5 times over 10 years with a neuropsychological assessment. We evaluated the associations of polymorphisms in APOE, CR1, BIN1, CLU, PICALM, ABCA7, MS4A6A, CD33, MS4A4E and CD2AP with level and change in 5 neuropsychological tests, assuming a dominant effect model. To optimize measurement, we used a mixed regression model with a latent process for each cognitive domain: global cognition (Mini Mental State Examination); verbal fluency (Isaac's Set Test); visual memory (Benton Visual Retention Test); information processing (Trail Making Test B) and literacy (National Adult Reading Test). APOE was associated with accelerated decline in global cognition and verbal fluency. Only two non-APOE genetic polymorphisms were associated with cognitive decline: CR1 was associated with rate of change in verbal fluency and BIN1 was associated with rate of change in global cognition. In a large prospective population-based study of dementia-free individuals, only a few cognitive domains were associated with established LOAD risk alleles. The most consistent associations were for global cognition and verbal fluency.},

  abstract = {In neurodegeneration research, normalization of regional volumes by intracranial volume (ICV) is important to estimate the extent of disease-driven atrophy. There is little agreement as to whether raw volumes, volume-to-ICV fractions or regional volumes from which the ICV factor has been regressed out should be used for volumetric brain imaging studies. Using multiple regional cortical and subcortical volumetric measures generated by Freesurfer (51 in total), the main aim of this study was to elucidate the implications of these adjustment approaches. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were analyzed from two large cohorts, the population-based PIVUS cohort (N = 406, all subjects age 75) and the Alzheimer disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort (N = 724). Further, we studied whether the chosen ICV normalization approach influenced the relationship between hippocampus and cognition in the three diagnostic groups of the ADNI cohort (Alzheimer's disease, mild cognitive impairment, and healthy individuals). The ability of raw vs. adjusted hippocampal volumes to predict diagnostic status was also assessed. In both cohorts raw volumes correlate positively with ICV, but do not scale directly proportionally with it. The correlation direction is reversed for all volume-to-ICV fractions, except the lateral and third ventricles. Most gray matter fractions are larger in females, while lateral ventricle fractions are greater in males. Residual correction effectively eliminated the correlation between the regional volumes and ICV and removed gender differences. The association between hippocampal volumes and cognition was not altered by ICV normalization. Comparing prediction of diagnostic status using the different approaches, small but significant differences were found. The choice of normalization approach should be carefully considered when designing a volumetric brain imaging study. FAU - Voevodskaya, Olga},

  abstract = {Imaging studies have provided new insights on the role of dopamine (DA) in drug abuse and addiction in the human brain. These studies have shown that the reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse in human beings are contingent not just on DA increases per se in the striatum (including the nucleus accumbens) but on the rate of DA increases. The faster the increases, the more intense the reinforcing effects. They have also shown that elevated levels of DA in the dorsal striatum are involved in the motivation to procure the drug when the addicted subject is exposed to stimuli associated with the drug (conditioned stimuli). In contrast, long-term drug use seems to be associated with decreased DA function, as evidenced by reductions in D2 DA receptors and DA release in the striatum in addicted subjects. Moreover, the reductions in D2 DA receptors in the striatum are associated with reduced activity of the orbitofrontal cortex (region involved with salience attribution and motivation and with compulsive behaviors) and of the cingulate gyrus (region involved with inhibitory control and impulsivity), which implicates deregulation of frontal regions by DA in the loss of control and compulsive drug intake that characterizes addiction. Because DA cells fire in response to salient stimuli and facilitate conditioned learning, their activation by drugs will be experienced as highly salient, driving the motivation to take the drug and further strengthening conditioned learning and producing automatic behaviors (compulsions and habits).}

Here, we integrate findings from positron emission tomography imaging studies on DA\&\#039;s role in drug abuse/addiction and in obesity and propose a common model for these two conditions. Both in abuse/addiction and in obesity, there is an enhanced value of one type of reinforcer (drugs and food, respectively) at the expense of other reinforcers, which is a consequence of conditioned learning and resetting of reward thresholds secondary to repeated stimulation by drugs (abuse/addiction) and by large quantities of palatable food (obesity) in vulnerable individuals (i.e. genetic factors). In this model, during exposure to the reinforcer or to conditioned cues, the expected reward (processed by memory circuits) overactivates the reward and motivation circuits while inhibiting the cognitive control circuit, resulting in an inability to inhibit the drive to consume the drug or food despite attempts to do so. These neuronal circuits, which are modulated by DA, interact with one another so that disruption in one circuit can be buffered by another, which highlights the need of multiprong approaches in the treatment of addiction and obesity.}

It is known that the neuropeptides that regulate energy balance (homeostatic processes) through the hypothalamus also modulate the activity of dopamine cells and their projections into regions involved in the rewarding processes underlying food intake. It is postulated that this could also be a mechanism by which overeating and the resultant resistance to homoeostatic signals impairs the function of circuits involved in reward sensitivity, conditioning and cognitive control.}

In 1998, 1,449 (73\%) individuals aged 65{\textendash}79 years were re-examined (average follow-up 21 years). A subpopulation (n = 112) was scanned with a 1.5-tesla MRI scanner in 1998, and WML were assessed from fluid-attenuated inversion recovery images using a semi-quantitative visual rating scale. \emph{Results:} Risk of late-life WML was related to midlife overweight (relative risk = 2.53; 95\% CI = 1.70{\textendash}2.89), obesity (2.94; 2.44{\textendash}3.03), and hypertension (2.73; 1.81{\textendash}3.08), even after adjustments for several confounding factors. Elevated BMI ({$>$}25) (2.26; 1.42{\textendash}2.62) and hypertension (3.14; 1.83{\textendash}3.40) from midlife to late life also increased the risk of WML. In addition, an association with WML was seen for decreasing blood pressure (hypertension at midlife but not at late life) (3.25; 2.46{\textendash}3.41), even after controlling for antihypertensive treatment. Lipid-lowering drugs had a protective effect against WML (0.13; 0.02{\textendash}0.59). \emph{Conclusions:} These results indicate that early and sustained vascular risk factor control is associated with a lower likelihood of having more severe WML in late life.}

  abstract = {Coherent fluctuations of spontaneous brain activity are present in distinct functional-anatomic brain systems during undirected wakefulness. However, the behavioral significance of this spontaneous activity has only begun to be investigated. Our previous studies have demonstrated that successful memory formation requires coordinated neural activity in a distributed memory network including the hippocampus and posteromedial cortices, specifically the precuneus and posterior cingulate (PPC), thought to be integral nodes of the default network. In this study, we examined whether intrinsic connectivity during the resting state between the hippocampus and PPC can predict individual differences in the performance of an associative memory task among cognitively intact older individuals. The intrinsic connectivity, between regions within the hippocampus and PPC that were maximally engaged during a subsequent memory fMRI task, was measured during a period of rest prior to the performance of the memory paradigm. Stronger connectivity between the hippocampal and posteromedial regions during rest predicted better performance on the memory task. Furthermore, hippocampal-PPC intrinsic connectivity was also significantly correlated with episodic memory measures on neuropsychological tests, but not with performance in non-memory domains. Whole-brain exploratory analyses further confirmed the spatial specificity of the relationship between hippocampal-default network posteromedial cortical connectivity and memory performance in older subjects. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that one of the functions of this large-scale brain network is to subserve episodic memory processes. Research is ongoing to determine if impaired connectivity between these regions may serve as a predictor of memory decline related to early Alzheimer's disease. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

Antihypertensive treatment reduced SBP/DBP by 8.3/4.6 mm Hg in young patients, by 10.7/4.2 mm Hg in old patients, and by 9.4/3.2 mm Hg in very old patients, respectively, resulting in ratios of DBP to SBP lowering of 0.55, 0.39, and 0.32, respectively (P=0.004 for trend with age). In spite of the differential lowering of SBP and DBP, antihypertensive treatment reduced the risk of all cardiovascular events, stroke and myocardial infarction in the 3 age strata to a similar extent. Absolute benefit increased with age and with lower ratio of DBP to SBP lowering. Furthermore, in patients with a larger-than-median reduction in SBP, active treatment consistently reduced the risk of all outcomes irrespective of the decrease in DBP or the achieved DBP. These findings remained consistent if the achieved DBP averaged {$<$}70 mm Hg. In conclusion, our overview suggests that antihypertensive drug treatment improves outcome mainly through lowering of SBP.},

Specifically, we evaluated both short-term ({$<$}1 hour apart) and long-term ({$>$}5 months apart) TRT reliability for 12 global and 6 local nodal network metrics. We found that reliability of global network metrics was overall low, threshold-sensitive and dependent on several factors of scanning time interval (TI, long-term{$>$}short-term), network membership (NM, networks excluding negative correlations{$>$}networks including negative correlations) and network type (NT, binarized networks{$>$}weighted networks). The dependence was modulated by another factor of node definition (ND) strategy. The local nodal reliability exhibited large variability across nodal metrics and a spatially heterogeneous distribution. Nodal degree was the most reliable metric and varied the least across the factors above. Hub regions in association and limbic/paralimbic cortices showed moderate TRT reliability. Importantly, nodal reliability was robust to above-mentioned four factors. Simulation analysis revealed that global network metrics were extremely sensitive (but varying degrees) to noise in functional connectivity and weighted networks generated numerically more reliable results in compared with binarized networks. For nodal network metrics, they showed high resistance to noise in functional connectivity and no NT related differences were found in the resistance. These findings provide important implications on how to choose reliable analytical schemes and network metrics of interest.}

  abstract = {Objectives White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are highly prevalent in older adults and considered to be a contributor to cognition impairment. However, the strategic WMH lesion distribution related to cognitive impairment is still debated. The aim of this study was to characterize the spatial patterns of WMH associated with cognitive impairment and explore its risk factors. Methods We retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and mini-mental state examination (MMSE) in two centers. WHM was classified into four patterns based on T2 FLAIR as follows: (1) multiple subcortical spots (multi-spots); (2) peri-basal ganglia (peri-BG); (3) anterior subcortical patches (anterior SC patches); and (4) posterior subcortical patches (posterior SC patches). We cross-sectionally and longitudinally estimated associations between different WMH patterns and all-cause dementia and cognitive decline. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was followed to identify risk factors of WMH patterns related to cognitive impairment. Results A total of 442 patients with WMH were enrolled, with average age of 71.6~{$\pm~$}11.3~years, and MMSE score of 24.1~{$\pm~$}5.4. Among them, 281 (63.6\%), 66 (14.9\%), 163 (36.9\%) and 197 (44.6\%) patients presented multi-spots, peri-BG, anterior SC patches and posterior SC patches, respectively. Patients with anterior SC patches were more likely to have all-cause dementia in cross-sectional study (OR 2.002; 95\% CI 1.098{\textendash}3.649; p~=~0.024), and have cognitive decline in longitudinal analysis (OR 3.029; 95\% CI 1.270{\textendash}7.223; p~=~0.012). Four patterns of WMH referred to different cognitive domains, and anterior SC patches had the most significant and extensive impact on cognition after Bonferroni multiple comparison correction (all p~{$<~$}0.0125). In addition, older age (OR 1.054; 95\% CI 1.027{\textendash}1.082; p~{$<~$}0.001), hypertension (OR 1.956; 95\% CI 1.145{\textendash}3.341; p~=~0.014), higher percentage of neutrophils (OR 1.046; 95\% CI 1.014{\textendash}1.080; p~=~0.005) and lower concentration of hemoglobin (OR 0.983; 95\% CI 0.967{\textendash}1.000; p~=~0.044) were risk factors for the presence of anterior SC patches. Conclusions Different patterns of subcortical leukoaraiosis visually identified on MRI might have different impacts on cognitive impairment. Further studies should be undertaken to validate this simple visual classification of WMH in different population.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine the magnitude of potentially causal relationships among vascular risk factors (VRFs), large-artery atheromatous disease (LAD), and cerebral white matter hyperintensities (WMH) in 2 prospective cohorts. Methods: We assessed VRFs (history and measured variables), LAD (in carotid, coronary, and leg arteries), and WMH (on structural MRI, visual scores and volume) in: (a) community-dwelling older subjects of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936, and (b) patients with recent nondisabling stroke. We analyzed correlations, developed structural equation models, and performed mediation analysis to test interrelationships among VRFs, LAD, and WMH. Results: In subjects of the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 (n = 881, mean age 72.5 years [SD {$\pm$}0.7 years], 49\% with hypertension, 33\% with moderate/severe WMH), VRFs explained 70\% of the LAD variance but only 1.4\% to 2\% of WMH variance, of which hypertension explained the most. In stroke patients (n = 257, mean age 74 years [SD {$\pm$}11.6 years], 61\% hypertensive, 43\% moderate/severe WMH), VRFs explained only 0.1\% of WMH variance. There was no direct association between LAD and WMH in either sample. The results were the same for all WMH measures used. Conclusions: The small effect of VRFs and LAD on WMH suggests that WMH have a large ``nonvascular,'' nonatheromatous etiology. VRF modification, although important, may be limited in preventing WMH and their stroke and dementia consequences. Investigation of, and interventions against, other suspected small-vessel disease mechanisms should be addressed.},

Despite being a common cause of stroke and vascular dementia, the underlying pathogenesis is poorly understood. Research in humans has identified several manifestations of cerebral microvessel endothelial dysfunction including blood{\textendash}brain barrier dysfunction, impaired vasodilation, vessel stiffening, dysfunctional blood flow and interstitial fluid drainage, white matter rarefaction, ischaemia, inflammation, myelin damage, and secondary neurodegeneration. These brain abnormalities are more dynamic and widespread than previously thought. Relationships between lesions and symptoms are highly variable but poorly understood. Major challenges are the determination of which vascular dysfunctions are most important in pathogenesis, which abnormalities are reversible, and why lesion progression and symptomatology are so variable. This knowledge will help to identify potential targets for intervention and improve risk prediction for individuals with small vessel disease.}

We prioritised the clinical outcomes of stroke, cognitive decline or dementia, dependency, death, mobility and mood disorders, and interventions of blood pressure lowering, antiplatelet drugs, lipid lowering, lifestyle modifications, glucose lowering and conventional treatments for dementia. We systematically reviewed the literature, assessed the evidence, formulated evidence-based recommendations where feasible, and expert consensus statements. We found little direct evidence, mostly of low quality. We recommend patients with ccSVD and hypertension to have their blood pressure well controlled; lower blood pressure targets may reduce ccSVD progression. We do not recommend antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin in ccSVD. We found little evidence on lipid lowering in ccSVD. Smoking cessation is a health priority. We recommend regular exercise which may benefit cognition, and a healthy diet, good sleep habits, avoiding obesity and stress for general health reasons.

Features seen on neuroimaging include recent small subcortical infarcts, lacunes, white matter hyperintensities, perivascular spaces, microbleeds, and brain atrophy. SVD can present as a stroke or cognitive decline, or can have few or no symptoms. SVD frequently coexists with neurodegenerative disease, and can exacerbate cognitive deficits, physical disabilities, and other symptoms of neurodegeneration. Terminology and definitions for imaging the features of SVD vary widely, which is also true for protocols for image acquisition and image analysis. This lack of consistency hampers progress in identifying the contribution of SVD to the pathophysiology and clinical features of common neurodegenerative diseases. We are an international working group from the Centres of Excellence in Neurodegeneration. We completed a structured process to develop definitions and imaging standards for markers and consequences of SVD. We aimed to achieve the following: first, to provide a common advisory about terms and definitions for features visible on MRI; second, to suggest minimum standards for image acquisition and analysis; third, to agree on standards for scientific reporting of changes related to SVD on neuroimaging; and fourth, to review emerging imaging methods for detection and quantification of preclinical manifestations of SVD. Our findings and recommendations apply to research studies, and can be used in the clinical setting to standardise image interpretation, acquisition, and reporting.

We assessed change in WMH volume from baseline to 1 year (normalized to percent intracranial volume [ICV]) and associations with baseline variables, clinical outcomes, and imaging parameters using multivariable analysis of covariance, model of changes, and multinomial logistic regression. RESULTS: Among 190 participants (mean age 65.3 years, range 34.3-96.9 years, 112 [59\%] male), WMH decreased in 71 participants by 1 year. At baseline, participants whose WMH decreased had similar WMH volumes but higher blood pressure (p = 0.0064) compared with participants whose WMH increased. At 1 year, participants with WMH decrease (expressed as percent ICV) had larger reductions in blood pressure ({$\beta$} = 0.0053, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.00099-0.0097 fewer WMH per 1-mm Hg decrease, p = 0.017) and in mean diffusivity in normal-appearing white matter ({$\beta$} = 0.075, 95\% CI 0.0025-0.15 fewer WMH per 1-unit mean diffusivity decrease, p = 0.043) than participants with WMH increase; those with WMH increase experienced more recurrent cerebrovascular events (32\%, vs 16\% with WMH decrease, {$\beta$} = 0.27, 95\% CI 0.047-0.50 more WMH per event, p = 0.018). CONCLUSIONS: Some WMH may regress after minor stroke, with potentially better clinical and brain tissue outcomes. The role of risk factor control requires verification. Interstitial fluid alterations may account for some WMH reversibility, offering potential intervention targets.},

Here, we investigate the association between inflammatory markers and changes in brain activity measured by regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) to assess the relationship between inflammation and brain function in older individuals.MethodsAnnual 15O water resting-state positron emission tomography (PET) scans collected over a 5-year period were assessed in 138 cognitively normal older participants (77 males; mean age at baseline = 71.3; mean scans per participant = 3.5) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging. Voxel-wise linear mixed models were used to investigate associations between rCBF and C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) at the time of scanning. We examined relationships between baseline CRP and IL-6 levels and baseline rCBF, and relationships between baseline and mean inflammatory levels over time and longitudinal rCBF changes.ResultsHigher baseline CRP and IL-6 were each associated with lower baseline rCBF primarily in frontal and occipital regions, with only the lingual gyrus surviving atrophy correction. Higher baseline and mean CRP were also associated with greater rCBF declines over time in anterior cingulate and hippocampal regions, whereas higher baseline and mean IL-6 levels were associated with greater rCBF declines in orbitofrontal and hippocampal regions.ConclusionsHigher levels of inflammation are associated with longitudinal changes in brain function in regions important for cognition. These results, along with previous studies, suggest that chronic inflammation in older adults may contribute to age-associated declines in cognitive function.}

  abstract = {White matter hyperintensities (WMH) progress with age and hypertension, but the key period of exposure to elevated blood pressure (BP), and the relative role of systolic BP (SBP) vs. diastolic BP (DBP), remains unclear. This study aims to determine the relationship between WMH and concurrent vs. past BP.~UK Biobank is a prospective community-based cohort of 40{\textendash}69-year olds from 22 centres, with magnetic resonance imaging in a subgroup of over 40~000 people at 4{\textendash}12\,years after baseline assessment. Standardized associations between WMH load (WMH volume normalized by total white matter volume and logit-transformed) and concurrent vs. past BP were determined using linear models, adjusted for age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, BP source, assessment centre, and time since baseline. Associations adjusted for regression dilution bias were determined between median WMH and usual SBP or DBP, stratified by age and baseline BP.In 37~041 eligible participants with WMH data and BP measures, WMH were more strongly associated with concurrent SBP [DBP: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.064, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.050{\textendash}0.078; SBP: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.076, 95\% CI 0.062{\textendash}0.090], but the strongest association was for past DBP (DBP: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.087, 95\% CI 0.064{\textendash}0.109; SBP: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.045, 95\% CI 0.022{\textendash}0.069), particularly under the age of 50 (DBP: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.103, 95\% CI 0.055{\textendash}0.152; SBP: {$\beta$}\,=\,0.012, 95\% CI -0.044 to 0.069). Due to the higher prevalence of elevated SBP, median WMH increased 1.126 (95\% CI 1.107{\textendash}1.146) per 10\,mmHg usual SBP and 1.106 (95\% CI 1.090{\textendash}1.122) per 5\,mmHg usual DBP, whilst the population attributable fraction of WMH in the top decile was greater for elevated SBP (19.1\% for concurrent SBP; 24.4\% for past SBP). Any increase in BP, even below 140 for SBP and below 90\,mmHg for DBP, and especially if requiring antihypertensive medication, was associated with increased WMH.WMH were strongly associated with concurrent and past elevated BP with the population burden of severe WMH greatest for SBP. However, before the age of 50, DBP was more strongly associated with WMH. Long-term prevention of WMH may require control of even mildly elevated midlife DBP.},

Current cross-sectional evidence suggests a clear link between loss of WM integrity (lower fractional anisotropy and higher mean diffusivity) and hypertension, obesity, diabetes, and smoking; a relationship that seems to hold for hearing loss, social isolation, depressive symptoms, and sleep disturbances. Physical activity, cognitive training, diet, and meditation, on the other hand, may protect WM with aging. Preliminary evidence from cross-sectional studies of treated risk factors suggests that modification of factors could slow down negative effects on WM microstructure.

The available studies provide conflicting results, which can be attributed to the complexity of variables influencing cognitive sex differences. In the present study, we tried to evaluate the magnitude of gender differences in verbal and visual-spatial functions and to correlate the results with a self-rating of these abilities in healthy men and women. Ninety-seven college students (51 women and 46 men) were examined with a neuropsychological battery, focusing on verbal and visual-spatial abilities. In general, we found, that women tend to perform at a higher level than men on most verbal tests and men outperform women on visual-spatial tasks. Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning, that the effect sizes were generally small, which suggests the assumption, that the overlap in the distribution of male and female scores is much greater than the difference between them. Additionally, in a self-rating scale, men rated their spatial abilities significantly superior to those of women, while women did not rate their verbal abilities superior to those of men.. In this context, the relevance of socio-cultural factors, educational factors and training on the occurrence of sex differences is highlighted, as these factors add significantly to the overall explanation of neuropsychological task-performance.

We review the potential role of impaired drainage of interstitial fluid in the pathogenesis of WMH and PVS. Whereas the volume of extracellular space in the grey matter is tightly controlled, fluid accumulates and expands the extracellular spaces of the white matter in acute hydrocephalus, vasogenic edema and WMH. Although there are no conventional lymphatic vessels in the brain, there is very effective lymphatic drainage for fluid and solutes along restricted pathways in the basement membranes of cerebral capillaries and arteries in young individuals. Lymphatic drainage of the brain is impaired with age and in association with apolipoprotein E {$\epsilon$}4, risk factors for Alzheimer's disease and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Deposition of proteins in the lymphatic drainage pathways in the walls of cerebral arteries with age is recognized as protein elimination failure angiopathy (PEFA), as in CAA and cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL). Facilitating perivascular lymphatic drainage from the aging brain may play a significant role in the prevention of CAA, WMH and Alzheimer's disease and may enhance the efficacy of immunotherapy for Alzheimer's disease.},

Additionally, compromised white matter integrity, as suggested by white matter hyperintensities or decreased regional white matter fractional anisotropy, has an adverse impact on cognitive functions. The human brain is, however, a network and it may be more appropriate to relate cognitive functions to properties of the network rather than specific brain regions. We report on graph theory-based analyses of diffusion tensor imaging tract-derived connectivity in a sample of 342 healthy individuals aged 72{\textendash}92 years. The cognitive domains included processing speed, memory, language, visuospatial, and executive functions. We examined the association of these cognitive assessments with both the connectivity of the whole brain network and individual cortical regions. We found that the efficiency of the whole brain network of cortical fiber connections had an influence on processing speed and visuospatial and executive functions. Correlations between connectivity of specific regions and cognitive assessments were also observed, e.g., stronger connectivity in regions such as superior frontal gyrus and posterior cingulate cortex were associated with better executive function. Similar to the relationship between regional connectivity efficiency and age, greater processing speed was significantly correlated with better connectivity of nearly all the cortical regions. For the first time, regional anatomical connectivity maps related to processing speed and visuospatial and executive functions in the elderly are identified.}

We report the topography of WMHs on T2-weighted fluid inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI in 428 individuals aged 44-48 years recruited randomly from a healthy community sample. WMHs were delineated from FLAIR and T1-weighted scans by using a computer algorithm, further verified and then classified using k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm into deep WMH (DWMH), and periventricular WMH (PVWMH), which included extended periventricular ?rims? and frontal and occipital ?caps?. Small caps and pencil-thin rims were not taken as WMHs for this analysis. The new computer algorithm was validated and compared with the scores of visual rating, and the correspondence between the two methods was high. We found that 218 (50.9\%) subjects had WMHs. 146 of the 218 (34.1\% of whole sample population of 428) subjects had deep white matter hyperintensities (DWMHs). The average number of WMH clusters (occurrences) per brain was 1.37 (0.94 for DWMH and 0.43 for pathological PVWMH) and the mean WMH tissue volume was 0.278 ml. There was no significant sex difference in the severity and distribution of WMHs. The study suggests that small punctate or focal WMHs are common in the brains of individuals in their 40s, and may represent an early stage of development of these lesions.

Early studies described signs of vascular abnormalities in the brains of severely ill COVID-19 patients that were verified by immunohistology in post-mortem tissue. With increasing evidence, it is now accepted that infection with SARS-CoV-2 affects the vasculature of various organs and that these effects may contribute to organ dysfunction. However, it is still unclear exactly what happens to the brain microvessels and which mechanisms are involved. In this issue of Brain, Lee and colleagues1 shed new light on the mystery of vascular effects of SARS-CoV-2, and thereby provide an explanation for why COVID-19 includes neurological symptoms.},

To better understand potential underlying mechanisms, we assessed microstructural brain integrity and cognitive performance relative to serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP). Methods: We cross-sectionally examined 447 community-dwelling and stroke-free individuals from the Systematic Evaluation and Alteration of Risk Factors for Cognitive Health (SEARCH) Health Study (mean age 63 years, 248 female). High-field MRI was performed in 321 of these subjects. Imaging measures included fluid-attenuated inversion recovery sequences for assessment of white matter hyperintensities, automated quantification of brain parenchyma volumes, and diffusion tensor imaging for calculation of global and regional white matter integrity, quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA). Psychometric analyses covered verbal memory, word fluency, and executive functions. Results: Higher levels of hs-CRP were associated with worse performance in executive function after adjustment for age, gender, education, and cardiovascular risk factors in multiple regression analysis ({$\beta$} = -0.095, p = 0.02). Moreover, higher hs-CRP was related to reduced global fractional anisotropy ({$\beta$} = -0.237, p \&amp;lt; 0.001), as well as regional FA scores of the frontal lobes ({$\beta$} = -0.246, p \&amp;lt; 0.001), the corona radiata ({$\beta$} = -0.222, p \&amp;lt; 0.001), and the corpus callosum ({$\beta$} = -0.141, p = 0.016), in particular the genu ({$\beta$} = -0.174, p = 0.004). We did not observe a significant association of hs-CRP with measures of white matter hyperintensities or brain atrophy. Conclusion: These data suggest that low-grade inflammation as assessed by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein is associated with cerebral microstructural disintegration that predominantly affects frontal pathways and corresponding executive function.

Intrinsic fluctuations of brain activity measured by fMRI during rest may be sensitive to AD-related neuropathology. In particular, functional connectivity of the default-mode network (DMN) has gained recent attention as a possible biomarker of disease processes and associated memory decline in AD. Here, we tested the hypothesis of APOE-related alterations in DMN functional connectivity in 95 healthy individuals between 50 and 80 years of age, including 33 carriers of the epsilon4 allele. Based on previous studies, we hypothesized increased hippocampal DMN synchronization in APOE epsilon4 carriers. This was supported using independent component analysis in combination with a dual-regression approach for analysis of resting state data. Whole-brain analysis suggested effects also in other areas, including the posterior cingulate cortex, parietal cortex, and parahippocampal regions. DMN synchronization showed a negative correlation with performance on a test of memory functioning, suggesting a neurocognitive significance of the brain activity patterns during rest. Our findings indicate that increased genetic vulnerability for AD is reflected in increased hippocampal DMN synchronization during rest several years before clinical manifestation. We propose that the results reflect epsilon4-related failure in hippocampal decoupling, which might elevate the total hippocampal metabolic burden and increase the risk of cognitive decline and AD. The results provide an important confirmation of specific genotype effects on intrinsic fluctuations and support the use of functional connectivity indices as imaging-derived endophenotypes in the emerging field of imaging genetics.},

The development of diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging, which is sensitive to microstructural changes not visible with conventional volumetric techniques, has led to a number of diffusion imaging studies in AD; these have largely focused on white matter changes. However, in AD cerebral grey matter is affected very early, with pathological studies suggesting that grey matter changes predate those in white matter. In this article we review the growing number of studies that assess grey matter diffusivity changes in AD. Although use of the technique is still at a relatively early stage, results so far have been promising. Initial studies identified changes in diffusion measures in the hippocampi of patients with mild cognitive impairment, which predated macroscopic volume loss, with positive predictive value for progression to AD dementia. More recent studies have identified abnormalities in multiple neocortical areas (particularly the posterior cingulate) at various stages of disease progression. Studies of patients who carry genetic mutations predisposing to autosomal dominant familial AD have shown cortical and subcortical grey matter diffusivity changes several years before the expected onset of the first clinical symptoms. The technique is not without potential methodological difficulties, especially relating to partial volume effects, although recent advances appear to be reducing such issues. Going forward, further utilization of grey matter diffusion measurements in AD may improve our understanding with regards to the timing and nature of the earliest presymptomatic neurodegenerative changes. This imaging technique may also be useful in comparing and contrasting subtle variations in different disease subgroups, and as a sensitive outcome measure for presymptomatic clinical trials in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Subcortical microvascular disease represented by brain white matter hyperintensity on magnetic resonance imaging is associated with functional decline in older people with hypertension. The effects of 2 levels of 24-hour average systolic blood pressure (BP) on mobility, white matter disease progression, and cognitive function over 3 years were studied. METHODS: This trial was a prospective, randomized, blinded end-points study in patients {$\geq$}75 years of age with systolic hypertension and magnetic resonance imaging evidence of white matter hyperintensity lesions. Patients were randomized to a 24-hour mean systolic BP of {$\leq$}130 mm\,Hg (intensive treatment) versus {$\leq$}145 mm\,Hg (standard treatment) with antihypertensive therapies. Primary study outcomes were changes in mobility (gait speed) and accrual of white matter hyperintensity volume after 3 years. Changes in cognitive function (executive processing) and adverse events were also evaluated. RESULTS: In 199 randomized patients, the mean age of the cohort was 80.5 years, and 54\% were women; the average 24-hour systolic BP was 149 mm\,Hg. Goal BPs were achieved after a median treatment period of 3 to 4 months; at that time, the mean 24-hour systolic BP was 127.7 mm\,Hg in the intensive treatment group and 144.0 mm\,Hg in the standard treatment group for an average difference of 16.3 mm\,Hg. Changes in gait speed were not different between treatment groups (0.40{$\pm$}2.0 versus 0.42{$\pm$}2.7 s in the intensive treatment and standard treatment groups, respectively; P=0.91), whereas changes from baseline in white matter hyperintensity volumes were smaller (0.29\%) in the intensive treatment group compared with the standard treatment group (0.48\%; P=0.03). Cognitive outcomes also were not different between the treatment groups. Major adverse cardiovascular events were higher in the standard treatment group compared with the intensive treatment group (17 versus 4 patients; P=0.01). Falls, with or without injury, and syncope were comparable in the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: Intensive lowering of ambulatory BP reduction in older patients with hypertension did not result in differences in mobility outcomes but was associated with a reduction in accrual of subcortical white matter disease. Over periods {$>$}3 years, a reduction in the accumulation of white matter disease may be a factor in conserving function. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: URL: https://www.clinicaltrials.gov.

  abstract = {Adiponectin is a recently described adipokine that has been recognized as a key regulator of insulin sensitivity and tissue inflammation. It is produced by adipose tissue (white and brown) and circulates in the blood at very high concentrations. It has direct actions in liver, skeletal muscle and the vasculature, with prominent roles to improve hepatic insulin sensitivity, increase fuel oxidation [via up-regulation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity] and decrease vascular inflammation. Adiponectin exists in the circulation as varying molecular weight forms, produced by multimerization. Recent data indicate that the high-molecular weight (HMW) complexes have the predominant action in the liver. In contrast to other adipokines, adiponectin secretion and circulating levels are inversely proportional to body fat content. Levels are further reduced in subjects with diabetes and coronary artery disease. Adiponectin antagonizes many effects of tumour necrosis factor-{$\alpha$}(TNF-{$\alpha$}) and this, in turn, suppresses adiponectin production. Furthermore, adiponectin secretion from adipocytes is enhanced by thiazolidinediones (which also act to antagonize TNF-{$\alpha$} effects). Thus, adiponectin may be the common mechanism by which TNF-{$\alpha$} promotes, and the thiazolidinediones suppress, insulin resistance and inflammation. Two adiponectin receptors, termed AdipoR1 and AdipoR2, have been identified and these are ubiquitously expressed. AdipoR1 is most highly expressed in skeletal muscle and has a prominent action to activate AMPK, and hence promote lipid oxidation. AdipoR2 is most highly expressed in liver, where it enhances insulin sensitivity and reduces steatosis via activation of AMPK and increased peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor {$\alpha$} ligand activity. T-cadherin, which is expressed in endothelium and smooth muscle, has been identified as an adiponectin-binding protein with preference for HMW adiponectin multimers. Given the low levels of adiponectin in subjects with the metabolic syndrome, and the beneficial effect of the adipokine in animal studies, there is exciting potential for adiponectin replacement therapy in insulin resistance and related disorders.},

  abstract = {Background: Numerous reports show that a centralized distribution of adiposity is a more dangerous risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes than total body obesity. No studies have evaluated whether the same pattern exists with dementia. The objective was to evaluate the association between midlife central obesity and risk of dementia three decades later. Methods: A longitudinal analysis was conducted of 6,583 members of Kaiser Permanente of Northern California who had their sagittal abdominal diameter (SAD) measured in 1964 to 1973. Diagnoses of dementia were from medical records an average of 36 years later, January 1, 1994, to June 16, 2006. Cox proportional hazard models adjusted for age, sex, race, education, marital status, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, stroke, heart disease, and medical utilization were conducted. Results: A total of 1,049 participants (15.9\%) were diagnosed with dementia. Compared with those in the lowest quintile of SAD, those in the highest had nearly a threefold increased risk of dementia (hazard ratio, 2.72; 95\% CI, 2.33-3.33), and this was only mildly attenuated after adding body mass index (BMI) to the model (hazard ratio, 1.92; 95\% CI, 1.58-2.35). Those with high SAD ({$>$} 25 cm) and normal BMI had an increased risk (hazard ratio, 1.89; 95\% CI, 0.98-3.81) vs those with low SAD ({$<$} 25 cm) and normal BMI (18.5-24.9 kg/m(2)), whereas those both obese (BMI {$>$} 30 kg/m(2)) and with high SAD had the highest risk of dementia (HR, 3.60; 95\% CI, 2.85-4.55). Conclusions: Central obesity in midlife increases risk of dementia independent of diabetes and cardiovascular comorbidities. Fifty percent of adults have central obesity; therefore, mechanisms linking central obesity to dementia need to be unveiled.},

Traditionally, researchers rely on a single measure (e.g., scale score) for a given construct for each person at each occasion of measurement, assuming that measure reflects the same construct at each occasion. With multiple indicators of a latent construct at each time of measurement, the researcher can evaluate whether factorial invariance holds. If factorial invariance constraints are satisfied, latent variable scores at each time of measurement are on the same metric and stronger conclusions are warranted. In this paper we discuss factorial invariance in longitudinal studies, contrasting analytic approaches and highlighting strengths of the multiple-indicator approach to modeling developmental processes.},

They are commonly preceded by hypertension, but the magnitude and clinical importance of this association is unclear. Aims Quantify the relationship between blood pressure and white matter hyperintensities across studies. Methods PubMed and EMBASE were searched for studies reporting associations between concurrent or historic blood pressure and white matter hyperintensities. Beta coefficients from linear models were extracted, whether standardized, unstandardized, unadjusted or adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors. Beta-coefficients were combined by fixed and random effects meta-analysis, combining standardized beta-coefficients or unstandardized coefficients measured by consistent methods. Results Twenty-five of 3230 papers were eligible, including 53,392 participants. Systolic blood pressure was significantly associated with white matter hyperintensity volume (WMHV) after maximal adjustment (standardized beta 0.096, 95\%CI 0.06{\textendash}0.133, p\,{$<$}\,0.001, I2\,=\,65\%), including for concurrent readings (b\,=\,0.106, p\,{$<$}\,0.001) or readings five years previously (b\,=\,0.077, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), and for younger or older populations (mean age\,{$<$}\,65: b\,=\,0.114; {$>$}65\,b\,=\,0.069). Unstandardized, adjusted associations were similar for raw WMHV, log-transformed WMHV, or WMHV as percentage of intracranial volume. Unadjusted associations with systolic blood pressure (SBP) were greater (standardized beta\,=\,0.273, 0.262{\textendash}0.284, p\,{$<$}\,0.0001). However, while associations with DBP were weaker than SBP (standardized beta\,=\,0.065, p\,{$<$}\,0.001), they were minimally affected by adjustment for age. Conclusions A standard deviation increase in SBP is associated with 10\% of a standard deviation increase in WMHV, providing the current best estimate of the potential reduction in progression of white matter hyperintensities expected with good control of blood pressure.},

Participants underwent cognitive testing, fasting blood draw, and FDG-PET at baseline. We used the homeostatic model assessment of peripheral insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). Regression analysis tested the statistical effect of HOMA-IR on global glucose metabolism. We used a voxelwise analysis to determine whether HOMA-IR predicted regional glucose metabolism. Finally, predicted variation in regional glucose metabolism was regressed against cognitive factors. Covariates included age, sex, body mass index, apolipoprotein E {$\epsilon$}4 genotype, AD parental history status, and a reference region used to normalize regional uptake.Main Outcomes and Measures~ Regional glucose uptake determined using FDG-PET and neuropsychological factors.Results~ Higher HOMA-IR was associated with lower global glucose metabolism ({$\beta$}\,=\,-0.29; P\,\&lt;\,.01) and lower regional glucose metabolism across large portions of the frontal, lateral parietal, lateral temporal, and medial temporal lobes (P\,\&lt;\,.001). The association was especially robust in the left medial temporal lobe (R2\,=\,0.178). Lower glucose metabolism in the left medial temporal lobe predicted by HOMA-IR was significantly related to worse performance on the immediate memory ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.317; t148\,=\,4.08; P\,\&lt;\,.001) and delayed memory ({$\beta$}\,=\,0.305; t148\,=\,3.895; P\,\&lt;\,.001) factor scores.Conclusions and Relevance~ Our results show that insulin resistance, a prevalent and increasingly common condition in developed countries, is associated with significantly lower regional cerebral glucose metabolism, which in turn may predict worse memory performance. Midlife may be a critical period for initiating treatments to lower peripheral insulin resistance to maintain neural metabolism and cognitive function.}

We also compared DTI trajectories in APOE {$\epsilon$}4 carriers vs. non-carriers and men vs. women. At baseline, higher vascular burden was associated with lower FA and higher MD in many WM structures including association, commissural, and projection fibers. Higher baseline vascular burden was also associated with greater longitudinal decline in FA in the hippocampal part of the cingulum and the fornix (crus)/stria terminalis and splenium of the corpus callosum, and with greater increases in MD in the splenium of the corpus callosum. APOE {$\epsilon$}4 carriers did not differ from non-carriers in baseline DTI metrics but had greater decline in FA in the genu and splenium of the corpus callosum. Men had higher FA and lower MD in multiple WM regions at baseline but showed greater increase in MD in the genu of the corpus callosum. Women showed greater decreases over time in FA in the gyrus part of the cingulum, compared to men. Our findings show that modifiable vascular risk factors (1) have a negative impact on white matter microstructure and (2) are associated with faster microstructural deterioration of temporal WM regions and the splenium of the corpus callosum in cognitively normal adults. Reducing vascular burden in aging could modify the rate of WM deterioration and could decrease age-related cognitive decline and impairment.},

A volunteer sample of 2832 persons (mean age, 73.6 years; 26\% black), living independently in 6 US cities, was recruited from senior housing, community centers, and hospitals and clinics. The study was conducted between April 1998 and December 2004. Five-year follow-up was completed in 67\% of the sample.InterventionsTen-session training for memory (verbal episodic memory), reasoning (inductive reasoning), or speed of processing (visual search and identification); 4-session booster training at 11 and 35 months after training in a random sample of those who completed training.Main Outcome MeasuresSelf-reported and performance-based measures of daily function and cognitive abilities.ResultsThe reasoning group reported significantly less difficulty in the instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) than the control group (effect size, 0.29; 99\% confidence interval [CI], 0.03-0.55). Neither speed of processing training (effect size, 0.26; 99\% CI, -0.002 to 0.51) nor memory training (effect size, 0.20; 99\% CI, -0.06 to 0.46) had a significant effect on IADL. The booster training for the speed of processing group, but not for the other 2 groups, showed a significant effect on the performance-based functional measure of everyday speed of processing (effect size, 0.30; 99\% CI, 0.08-0.52). No booster effects were seen for any of the groups for everyday problem-solving or self-reported difficulty in IADL. Each intervention maintained effects on its specific targeted cognitive ability through 5 years (memory: effect size, 0.23 [99\% CI, 0.11-0.35]; reasoning: effect size, 0.26 [99\% CI, 0.17-0.35]; speed of processing: effect size, 0.76 [99\% CI, 0.62-0.90]). Booster training produced additional improvement with the reasoning intervention for reasoning performance (effect size, 0.28; 99\% CI, 0.12-0.43) and the speed of processing intervention for speed of processing performance (effect size, 0.85; 99\% CI, 0.61-1.09).ConclusionsReasoning training resulted in less functional decline in self-reported IADL. Compared with the control group, cognitive training resulted in improved cognitive abilities specific to the abilities trained that continued 5 years after the initiation of the intervention.Trial Registrationclinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00298558}

Ninety-two cognitively normal older adults (75.2 {$\pm$} 5.6~years) reported lifetime cognitive activity and current physical activity using validated questionnaires. For each participant, we evaluated cortical A{$\beta$} burden (using [11C] labeled Pittsburgh-Compound-B positron emission tomography), cerebrovascular lesions (using magnetic resonance imaging-defined white matter lesion [WML]), and neural integrity within AD regions (using a multimodal neuroimaging biomarker). Path models (adjusted for age, gender, and education) indicated that higher lifetime cognitive activity and higher current physical activity was associated with fewer WMLs. Lower WML volumes were in turn related to higher neural integrity and higher global cognitive functioning. As shown previously, higher lifetime cognitive activity was associated with lower [11C] labeled Pittsburgh-Compound-B retention, which itself moderated the impact of neural integrity on cognitive functioning. Lifestyle activity may thus promote cognitive health in aging by protecting against cerebrovascular pathology and A{$\beta$} pathology thought to be relevant to AD development.},

The plant-derived polyphenol resveratrol has been shown to increase memory performance in primates; however, interventional studies in older humans are lacking. Here, we tested whether supplementation of resveratrol would enhance memory performance in older adults and addressed potential mechanisms underlying this effect. Twenty-three healthy overweight older individuals that successfully completed 26 weeks of resveratrol intake (200 mg/d) were pairwise matched to 23 participants that received placebo (total n = 46, 18 females, 50-75 years). Before and after the intervention/control period, subjects underwent memory tasks and neuroimaging to assess volume, microstructure, and functional connectivity (FC) of the hippocampus, a key region implicated in memory functions. In addition, anthropometry, glucose and lipid metabolism, inflammation, neurotrophic factors, and vascular parameters were assayed. We observed a significant effect of resveratrol on retention of words over 30 min compared with placebo (p = 0.038). In addition, resveratrol led to significant increases in hippocampal FC, decreases in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body fat, and increases in leptin compared with placebo (all p {$<$} 0.05). Increases in FC between the left posterior hippocampus and the medial prefrontal cortex correlated with increases in retention scores and with decreases in HbA1c (all p {$<$} 0.05). This study provides initial evidence that supplementary resveratrol improves memory performance in association with improved glucose metabolism and increased hippocampal FC in older adults. Our findings offer the basis for novel strategies to maintain brain health during aging.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity has been related to the incidence of dementia but its impact on cognitive performance in persons without dementia is less clear. We hypothesized that mid-life obesity may modulate the impact of conventional cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF) on cognitive impairment. We tested this hypothesis in the community-based Framingham Offspring Study sample. METHODS: At Examination cycle 4 (1988-90) of the Offspring Cohort, indices of obesity (BMI and Waist-Hip Ratio [WHR]) and baseline CVRF levels were ascertained in 1,814 men and women, aged 40-69 years. Obesity and hypertension were related to the score on each of 8 neurocognitive tests measured at Examination 8, 12 years later (1999-2002). RESULTS: Midlife measures of central obesity (WHR in the uppermost quartile- Q4) and of hypertension (BP {$>$} or = 140 / {$>$} or = 90 or use of anti-hypertensive medication) were each significantly related to poorer performance on executive function \& visuomotor skills (Trails B, Visual Reproductions-Immediate and Delayed Recall). Further, the relation of hypertension to neurocognitive performance was significantly modified by WHR; hypertension was not associated with neurocognitive performance in WHR Q1-Q3, but was associated with a marked adverse performance in Q4 WHR. Neither HTN nor obesity was individually or synergistically related to verbal memory (immediate or delayed recall). CONCLUSIONS: Executive function and visuomotor skills were differentially affected by the combined presence of midlife hypertension and Q4 WHR while measures of verbal memory function were not related to these risk factors in our sample, a pattern consistent with vascular cognitive impairment. Control of mid-life elevated blood pressure and central obesity may be strategies to reduce cognitive decline with age.},

By this means it is hoped both to measure changes in cardiovascular mortality and to see how far they are explained; on the one hand by changes in incidence mediated by risk factor levels; and on the other by changes in case-fatality rates, related to medical care. Population centres need to be large and numerous; to reliably establish 10-year trends in event rates within a centre 200 or more fatal events in men per year are needed, while for the collaborative study a multiplicity of internally homogeneous centres showing differing trends will provide the best test of the hypotheses.

We constructed structural brain networks composed of 90 regions in young, middle, and old age groups. We randomly selected 350 healthy subjects for each group from a Japanese magnetic resonance image database. Structural brain networks in three age groups showed economical small?world properties, providing high global and local efficiency for parallel information processing at low connection cost. The small?world efficiency and node betweenness varied significantly and revealed a U? or inverted U?curve model tendency among three age groups. Results also demonstrated that structural brain networks exhibited a modular organization in which the connections between regions are much denser within modules than between them. The modular organization of structural brain networks was similar between the young and middle age groups, but quite different from the old group. In particular, the old group showed a notable decrease in the connector ratio and the intermodule connections. Combining the results of small?world efficiency, node betweenness and modular organization, we concluded that the brain network changed slightly, developing into a more distributed organization from young to middle age. The organization eventually altered greatly, shifting to a more localized organization in old age. Our findings provided quantitative insights into topological principles of structural brain networks and changes related to normal aging. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012. ? 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Nonetheless, these findings are heterogeneous and have not been quantitatively reviewed. Thus, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis that identified consistent results of existing resting-state fMRI studies to determine concordant resting-state neural brain activity alterations in T2DM patients. A systematic search was conducted for resting-state fMRI studies comparing T2DM patients with healthy controls. Coordinates were extracted from clusters with significant differences. The meta-analysis was performed using the activation likelihood estimation method, and nine studies were included. This meta-analysis identified robustly reduced resting-state brain activity in the whole brain of T2DM patients, including the bilateral lingual gyrus, left postcentral gyrus, right inferior temporal gyrus, right cerebellar culmen, right insula and right posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). The present study demonstrates a characteristic pattern of resting-state brain anomalies that will contribute to the understanding of neuropathophysiological mechanisms underlying T2DM.}

BMI correlated negatively with fractional anisotropy and axial eigenvalues (lambda(1)) in the body of corpus callosum (CC), positively with mean diffusivity and radial eigenvalues (See figure in text) in the fornix and splenium of CC, and positively with lambda(1) in the right corona radiata (CR) and superior longitudinal fasciculus (SLF). These data indicate that BMI correlates negatively with WM integrity in the fornix and CC. Furthermore, the different patterns of BMI-related differences in DTI parameters at the fornix, body, and splenium of the CC, and the right CR and SLF suggest that different biological processes may underlie BMI-related impairments of WM integrity in different brain regions.},

  abstract = {Summary Background The mechanisms by which any upper respiratory virus, including SARS-CoV-2, impairs chemosensory function are not known. COVID-19 is frequently associated with olfactory dysfunction after viral infection, which provides a research opportunity to evaluate the natural course of this neurological finding. Clinical trials and prospective and histological studies of new-onset post-viral olfactory dysfunction have been limited by small sample sizes and a paucity of advanced neuroimaging data and neuropathological samples. Although data from neuropathological specimens are now available, neuroimaging of the olfactory system during the acute phase of infection is still rare due to infection control concerns and critical illness and represents a substantial gap in knowledge. Recent developments The active replication of SARS-CoV-2 within the brain parenchyma (ie, in neurons and glia) has not been proven. Nevertheless, post-viral olfactory dysfunction can be viewed as a focal neurological deficit in patients with COVID-19. Evidence is also sparse for a direct causal relation between SARS-CoV-2 infection and abnormal brain findings at autopsy, and for trans-synaptic spread of the virus from the olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulb. Taken together, clinical, radiological, histological, ultrastructural, and molecular data implicate inflammation, with or without infection, in either the olfactory epithelium, the olfactory bulb, or both. This inflammation leads to persistent olfactory deficits in a subset of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Neuroimaging has revealed localised inflammation in intracranial olfactory structures. To date, histopathological, ultrastructural, and molecular evidence does not suggest that SARS-CoV-2 is an obligate neuropathogen. Where next? The prevalence of CNS and olfactory bulb pathosis in patients with COVID-19 is not known. We postulate that, in people who have recovered from COVID-19, a chronic, recrudescent, or permanent olfactory deficit could be prognostic for an increased likelihood of neurological sequelae or neurodegenerative disorders in the long term. An inflammatory stimulus from the nasal olfactory epithelium to the olfactory bulbs and connected brain regions might accelerate pathological processes and symptomatic progression of neurodegenerative disease. Persistent olfactory impairment with or without perceptual distortions (ie, parosmias or phantosmias) after SARS-CoV-2 infection could, therefore, serve as a marker to identify people with an increased long-term risk of neurological disease.}

Whether visceral fat accumulation, as measured by computed tomography (CT), is an independent risk factor for the presence of cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) was investigated. Methods This study comprised 506 Japanese subjects 35?74~years of age (mean 55.3~years) without a history of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease who underwent health screening tests, including brain magnetic resonance imaging, carotid echography and measurements of the visceral fat area (VFA) and subcutaneous fat area (SFA) on abdominal CT. Visceral fat accumulation was defined as VFA {$\geq$} 100~cm2. Logistic regression analysis was performed to examine the associations between visceral fat accumulation and cerebral SVD such as white matter lesions (WMLs) and silent lacunar infarction (SLI). Results The prevalence of WMLs and SLI but not carotid plaque were significantly higher in subjects with VFA {$\geq$} 100~cm2 than those with VFA {$<$} 100~cm2. A VFA {$\geq$} 100~cm2 was associated with WMLs and SLI independent of age, cardiovascular risk factors and other measurements of obesity, such as waist circumference and body mass index. A large waist circumference was independently associated with SLI. SFA, the combination of VFA and SFA, and body mass index were not associated with WMLs or SLI. Conclusions Visceral fat accumulation was independently associated with the presence of cerebral SVD in subjects without a history of symptomatic cerebrovascular disease.},

Strong evidence from clinical and basic research suggests that a major pathway by which APOE4 increases the risk of AD is by driving earlier and more abundant amyloid pathology in the brains of APOE*epsilon4 carriers. The number of amyloid-beta (Abeta)-dependent and Abeta-independent pathways that are known to be differentially modulated by APOE isoforms is increasing. For example, evidence is accumulating that APOE influences tau pathology, tau-mediated neurodegeneration and microglial responses to AD-related pathologies. In addition, APOE4 is either pathogenic or shows reduced efficiency in multiple brain homeostatic pathways, including lipid transport, synaptic integrity and plasticity, glucose metabolism and cerebrovascular function. Here, we review the recent progress in clinical and basic research into the role of APOE in AD pathogenesis. We also discuss how APOE can be targeted for AD therapy using a precision medicine approach.},

Specifically, these studies identified rigidity in place cell remapping in similar environments in the CA3. We used high-resolution fMRI to examine activity profiles in the dentate gyrus and CA3 in young and older adults as stimulus similarity was incrementally varied. We report evidence for ``representational rigidity'' in older adults' dentate/CA3 that is linked to behavioral discrimination deficits. Using ultrahigh-resolution diffusion imaging, we quantified both the integrity of the perforant path as well as dentate/CA3 dendritic changes and found that both were correlated with dentate/CA3 functional rigidity. These results highlight structural and functional alterations in the hippocampal network that predict age-related changes in memory function and present potential targets for intervention.}

Given the growing size of the aging population, there is an imperative to study age?related neurocognitive changes in order to better parse healthy from pathological aging. Using a behavioral paradigm that taxes pattern separation (the ability to differentiate novel yet similar information from previously learned information and thus avoid interference), we investigated age?related neural changes in the human hippocampus using high?resolution (1.5 mm isotropic) blood?oxygenation level?dependent fMRI. Recent evidence from animal studies suggests that hyperactivity in the CA3 region of the hippocampus may underlie behavioral deficits in pattern separation in aged rats. Here, we report evidence that is consistent with findings from the animal studies. We found a behavioral impairment in pattern separation in a sample of healthy older adults compared with young controls. We also found a related increase in CA3/dentate gyrus activity levels during an fMRI contrast that stresses pattern separation abilities. In a detailed analysis of behavior, we also found that the pattern of impairment was consistent with the predictions of the animal model, where larger changes in the input (greater dissimilarity) were required in order for elderly adults to successfully encode new information as distinct from previously learned information. These findings are also consistent with recent fMRI and behavioral reports in healthy aging, and further suggest that a specific functional deficit in the CA3/dentate network contributes to memory difficulties with aging. ? 2010 Wiley?Liss, Inc.},

Over this period, PD patients demonstrate significantly greater cortical thinning than controls in parts of the left occipital and bilateral frontal lobes and right somatomotor-sensory cortex. Cortical thinning is correlated to connectivity (measured functionally or structurally) to a ``disease reservoir'' evaluated by MRI at baseline. The atrophy pattern in the ventral frontal lobes resembles one described in certain cases of Alzheimer's disease. Our findings suggest that disease propagation to the cortex in PD follows neuronal connectivity and that disease spread to the cortex may herald the onset of cognitive impairment.}

We found that larger PFC volume and greater PFC thickness were associated with better executive performance. Stronger associations between executive functions and PFC volume were linked to greater variance in the sample age but was unrelated to the mean age of a sample. Strength of association between cognitive and neuroanatomical indices depended on the executive task used in the study. PFC volume correlated stronger with Wisconsin Card Sorting Test than with digit backwards span, Trail Making Test and verbal fluency.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Obesity is a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, but the most predictive measure for different ethnic populations is not clear. We aimed to assess whether markers of obesity, especially waist-to-hip ratio, would be stronger indicators of myocardial infarction than body-mass index (BMI), the conventional measure. METHODS: We did a standardised case-control study of acute myocardial infarction with 27 098 participants in 52 countries (12,461 cases and 14,637 controls) representing several major ethnic groups. We assessed the relation between BMI, waist and hip circumferences, and waist-to-hip ratio to myocardial infarction overall and for each group. FINDINGS: BMI showed a modest and graded association with myocardial infarction (OR 1.44, 95\% CI 1.32-1.57 top quintile vs bottom quintile before adjustment), which was substantially reduced after adjustment for waist-to-hip ratio (1.12, 1.03-1.22), and non-significant after adjustment for other risk factors (0.98, 0.88-1.09). For waist-to-hip ratio, the odds ratios for every successive quintile were significantly greater than that of the previous one (2nd quintile: 1.15, 1.05-1.26; 3rd quintile: 1.39; 1.28-1.52; 4th quintile: 1.90, 1.74-2.07; and 5th quintiles: 2.52, 2.31-2.74 [adjusted for age, sex, region, and smoking]). Waist (adjusted OR 1.77; 1.59-1.97) and hip (0.73; 0.66-0.80) circumferences were both highly significant after adjustment for BMI (p{$<$}0.0001 top vs bottom quintiles). Waist-to-hip ratio and waist and hip circumferences were closely (p{$<$}0.0001) associated with risk of myocardial infarction even after adjustment for other risk factors (ORs for top quintile vs lowest quintiles were 1.75, 1.33, and 0.76, respectively). The population-attributable risks of myocardial infarction for increased waist-to-hip ratio in the top two quintiles was 24.3\% (95\% CI 22.5-26.2) compared with only 7.7\% (6.0-10.0) for the top two quintiles of BMI. INTERPRETATION: Waist-to-hip ratio shows a graded and highly significant association with myocardial infarction risk worldwide. Redefinition of obesity based on waist-to-hip ratio instead of BMI increases the estimate of myocardial infarction attributable to obesity in most ethnic groups.},

  abstract = {BackgroundPeak width of skeletonized mean diffusivity (PSMD) is a promising diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) marker that shows consistent and strong cognitive associations in the context of different cerebral small vessel diseases (cSVD).PurposeInvestigate whether PSMD (1) is higher in patients with Cerebral Amyloid Angiopathy (CAA) than those with arteriolosclerosis; (2) can capture the anteroposterior distribution of CAA-related abnormalities; (3) shows similar neuroimaging and cognitive associations in comparison to other classical DTI markers, such as average mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA).Materials and methodsWe analyzed cross-sectional neuroimaging and neuropsychological data from 90 non-demented memory-clinic subjects from a single center. Based on MRI findings, we classified them into probable-CAA (those that fulfilled the modified Boston criteria), subjects with MRI markers of cSVD not attributable to CAA (presumed arteriolosclerosis; cSVD), and subjects without evidence of cSVD on MRI (non-cSVD). We compared total and lobe-specific (frontal and occipital) DTI metrics values across the groups. We used linear regression models to investigate how PSMD, MD, and FA correlate with conventional neuroimaging markers of cSVD and cognitive scores in CAA.ResultsPSMD was comparable in probable-CAA (median 4.06 {\texttimes} 10{\textendash}4 mm2/s) and cSVD (4.07 {\texttimes} 10{\textendash}4 mm2/s) patients, but higher than in non-cSVD (3.30 {\texttimes} 10{\textendash}4 mm2/s; p {$<$} 0.001) subjects. Occipital-frontal PSMD gradients were higher in probable-CAA patients, and we observed a significant interaction between diagnosis and region on PSMD values [F(2, 87) = 3.887, p = 0.024]. PSMD was mainly associated with white matter hyperintensity volume, whereas MD and FA were also associated with other markers, especially with the burden of perivascular spaces. PSMD correlated with worse executive function ({$\beta$} = -0.581, p {$<$} 0.001) and processing speed ({$\beta$} = -0.463, p = 0.003), explaining more variance than other MRI markers. MD and FA were not associated with performance in any cognitive domain.ConclusionPSMD is a promising biomarker of cognitive impairment in CAA that outperforms other conventional and DTI-based neuroimaging markers. Although global PSMD is similarly increased in different forms of cSVD, PSMD's spatial variations could potentially provide insights into the predominant type of underlying microvascular pathology.},

  abstract = {Objective: To determine whether MRI markers, including diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), can predict cognitive decline and dementia in patients with cerebral small vessel disease (SVD).Methods: In the prospective St George\&\#039;s Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke study, multimodal MRI was performed annually for 3 years and cognitive assessments annually for 5 years in a cohort of 99 patients with SVD, defined as symptomatic lacunar stroke and confluent white matter hyperintensities (WMH). Progression to dementia was determined in all patients. Progression of WMH, brain volume, lacunes, cerebral microbleeds, and a DTI measure (the normalized peak height of the mean diffusivity histogram distribution) as a marker of white matter microstructural damage were determined.Results: Over 5 years of follow-up, 18 patients (18.2\%) progressed to dementia. A significant change in all MRI markers, representing deterioration, was observed. The presence of new lacunes, and rate of increase in white matter microstructural damage on DTI, correlated with both decline in executive function and global functioning. Growth of WMH and deterioration of white matter microstructure on DTI predicted progression to dementia. A model including change in MRI variables together with their baseline values correctly classified progression to dementia with a C statistic of 0.85.Conclusions: This longitudinal prospective study provides evidence that change in MRI measures including DTI, over time durations during which cognitive change is not detectable, predicts cognitive decline and progression to dementia. It supports the use of MRI measures, including DTI, as useful surrogate biomarkers to monitor disease and assess therapeutic interventions.AUC=area under the receiver operating characteristic curve; CMB=cerebral microbleeds; DSM-5=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition; DTI=diffusion tensor imaging; EF=executive function; IADL=Instrumental Activities of Daily Living; LME=linear mixed effect; MD=mean diffusivity; MMSE=Mini-Mental State Examination; NAWM=normal-appearing white matter; NPH=normalized peak height; PS=processing speed; SCANS=St George\&\#039;s Cognition and Neuroimaging in Stroke; SVD=small vessel disease; WM=white matter; WMH=white matter hyperintensities}

We fit approximately 1.92 million voxel-level Cox proportional hazard models to examine the grey matter volume effect on time to event, adjusting for age, sex, and diabetes. We used the significance threshold of p {$\mkern1mu<$} {$\mkern1mu$}0.005 with contiguity threshold of at least 68 voxels (false detection probability {$<$}2.5{\texttimes}10~-8 ). Areas within the mesial temporal lobe (MTL), anterior temporal lobe, hippocampus, and posterior cingulate gyrus were associated with time to MCI or AD. The presence of white matter lesions (a marker of small vessel disease in the brain) was associated with the volumes of the MTL and precuneus; MRI-identified infarcts also predicted MTL volume. These findings are important because we identified critical brain regions that predict a person's increased likelihood of developing MCI or AD over a decade prior to the onset of clinical symptoms; these critical brain regions were themselves affected by the presence of vascular disease.},

The assumption has been that motion causes artifactual differences in brain connectivity that must and can be corrected. Here we propose that differences in brain connectivity can also represent a neurobiological trait that predisposes to differences in motion. We support this possibility with an analysis of intra- versus intersubject differences in connectivity comparing high- to low-motion subgroups. Intersubject analysis identified a correlate of head motion consisting of reduced distant functional connectivity primarily in the default network in individuals with high head motion. Similar connectivity differences were not found in analysis of intrasubject data. Instead, this correlate of head motion was a stable property in individuals across time. These findings suggest that motion-associated differences in brain connectivity cannot fully be attributed to motion artifacts but rather also reflect individual variability in functional organization.},

This study analysis systematically evaluated the effects of systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) on the progression of WMLs. \textbf{\emph{Methods:}} We searched the MeSH terms: ``white matter,'' ``blood pressure,'' ``hypertension,'' ``Leukoencephalopathy,'' and ``leukoaraiosis'' on PubMed and Cochrane from January 2000 to August 2019. A total of 12 closely related literature were included for research. \textbf{\emph{Results:}} The results of the meta-analysis showed that the increase of both SBP and DBP can promote the progression of WMLs (respectively, odds ratio [OR] = 2.90, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 2.86{\textendash}2.94; OR = 3.13, 95\% CI 3.03{\textendash}3.23). Subgroup analysis found that patients with hypertension aged younger than 70 years are at a greater risk of WML progression when their DBP increased (OR = 4.69, 95\% CI 3.31{\textendash}6.65). \textbf{\emph{Conclusion:}} The relationship between DBP and WMLs is closer than that of SBP. Also, the risk of WML progression in patients aged under 70 years was higher than that in patients aged over 70 years. Furthermore, when DBP is elevated in patients younger than 70 years of age, the risk of WML progression may be higher. Therefore, it is expected that more researchers will attach importance to the change in DBP and identify the range of blood pressure and strategies that control DBP, thus contributing to delay the progression of WMLs.}

  abstract = {Abstract Lifespan is a dynamic process with remarkable changes in brain structure and function. Previous neuroimaging studies have indicated age?related microstructural changes in specific white matter tracts during development and aging. However, the age?related alterations in the topological architecture of the white matter structural connectome across the human lifespan remain largely unknown. Here, a cohort of 113 healthy individuals (ages 9?85) with both diffusion and structural MRI acquisitions were examined. For each participant, the high?resolution white matter structural networks were constructed by deterministic fiber tractography among 1024 parcellation units and were quantified with graph theoretical analyses. The global network properties, including network strength, cost, topological efficiency, and robustness, followed an inverted U?shaped trajectory with a peak age around the third decade. The brain areas with the most significantly nonlinear changes were located in the prefrontal and temporal cortices. Different brain regions exhibited heterogeneous trajectories: the posterior cingulate and lateral temporal cortices displayed prolonged maturation/degeneration compared with the prefrontal cortices. Rich?club organization was evident across the lifespan, whereas hub integration decreased linearly with age, especially accompanied by the loss of frontal hubs and their connections. Additionally, age?related changes in structural connections were predominantly located within and between the prefrontal and temporal modules. Finally, based on the graph metrics of structural connectome, accurate predictions of individual age were obtained (r?=?0.77). Together, the data indicated a dynamic topological organization of the brain structural connectome across human lifespan, which may provide possible structural substrates underlying functional and cognitive changes with age.

The association between the spatial distribution of WMLs and cognitive function was examined using diffusion tensor imaging data. WML burden significantly associated with increasing age (r=0.318, p{$<$}0.001) and cognitive decline. Eight of 15 neuropsychological measures could be accurately predicted, and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) test achieved the highest predictive accuracy (CORR=0.28, p{$<$}0.003). WMLs located in bilateral tapetum, posterior corona radiata, and thalamic radiation contributed the most prediction power. Diffusion indexes in these regions associated significantly with cognitive performance (axial diffusivity{$>$}radial diffusivity{$>$}mean diffusivity{$>$}fractional anisotropy). These results show that the combination of the extent and location of WMLs exhibit great potential to serve as a generalizable marker of multidomain neurocognitive decline in the aging population.

METHODS: We studied 565 healthy, middle-aged, black and white men and women in the CARDIA (Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults) Study. The fitness measure was symptom-limited maximal treadmill test duration (Maxdur); brain MRI was measured 5 years later. Brain MRI measures were analyzed as means and as proportions below the 15th percentile (above the 85th percentile for white matter abnormal tissue volume). RESULTS: Per 1-minute-higher Maxdur, the odds ratio for having less whole brain volume was 0.85 (p = 0.04) and for having low white matter integrity was 0.80 (p = 0.02), adjusted for age, race, sex, clinic, body mass index, smoking, alcohol, diet, physical activity, education, blood pressure, diabetes, total cholesterol, and lung function (plus intracranial volume for white matter integrity). No significant associations were observed between Maxdur and abnormal tissue volume or blood flow in white matter. Findings were similar for associations with continuous brain MRI measures. CONCLUSIONS: Greater physical fitness was associated with more brain volume and greater white matter integrity measured 5 years later in middle-aged adults.},

  abstract = {The clinical significance of dilated Virchow-Robin spaces (dVRS) remains unclear and their impact on cognitive performances has only been reported in small sample studies. Our aim was to assess the association between severity of dVRS and risk of incident dementia and cognitive decline in an elderly cohort. The degree of dVRS in both white matter and basal ganglia were ranked using high-resolution 3D MRI in a population-based sample of 1,778 non-demented participants from 65 to 80 years of age, who had a cerebral MRI at baseline. Cognitive function was assessed and dementia was diagnosed during a 4-year follow-up period. Cox proportional hazard models were used to examine the association between dVRS degree on a four-level severity score and incident dementia. The relationship between dVRS degree and change in cognition was examined using linear mixed effect models. During 6,135 person-years of follow-up, 27 individuals developed dementia. The highest degree of dVRS was associated with a strong increase in the risk of incident dementia independently of other standard risk factors of dementia, both for dVRS in white matter (HR = 9.8, 95\% CI 1.7{\textendash}55.3) and in basal ganglia (HR = 5.8, 95\% CI 1.2{\textendash}28.4). After further adjustment on white matter hyperintensity volume and brain infarcts, this association remained significant for dVRS in white matter. Higher rate of cognitive decline was found to be related to high degree of dVRS in basal ganglia but not in white matter. These results need confirmation but they suggest that assessment of the severity of dVRS may help identify groups of individuals that are at increased risk of dementia.},

  abstract = {In the absence of treatment options, the WHO emphasizes the identification of effective prevention strategies as a key element to counteract the dementia epidemic. Regarding the complex nature of dementia, trials simultaneously targeting multiple risk factors should be particularly effective for prevention. So far, however, only few such multi-component trials have been launched, but yielding promising results. In Germany, comparable initiatives are lacking, and translation of these complex interventions into routine care was not yet done. Therefore, AgeWell.de will be conducted as the first multi-component prevention trial in Germany which is closely linked to the primary care setting.}
